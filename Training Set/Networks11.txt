"Attacking NTP's Authenticated Broadcast Mode." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 46.2 (2016): 12-17.
We identify two attacks on the Network Time Protocol (NTP)’s cryptographically-authenticated broadcast mode. First, we present a replay attack that allows an on-path attacker to indefinitely stick a broadcast client to a specific time. Second, we present a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that allows an off-path attacker to prevent a broadcast client from ever updating its system clock; to do this, the attacker sends the client a single malformed broadcast packet per query interval. Our DoS attack also applies to all other NTP modes that are ‘ephemeral’ or ‘preemptable’ (including manycast, pool, etc). We then use network measurements to give evidence that NTP’s broadcast and other ephemeral/preemptable modes are being used in the wild. We conclude by discussing why NTP’s current implementation of symmetric-key cryptographic authentication does not provide security in broadcast mode, and make some recommendations to improve the current state of affairs.
