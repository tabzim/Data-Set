"Correctness of belief propagation in Gaussian graphical models of arbitrary topology." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Local "belief propagation" rules of the sort proposed by Pearl [15] are 
guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly 
connected graphical models. Recently, a number of researchers have em- 
pirically demonstrated good performance of "1oopy belief propagation"- 
using these same rules on graphs with loops. Perhaps the most dramatic 
instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of "Turbo codes", whose 
decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation. 
Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theo- 
retical understanding of the performance of 1oopy propagation. Here we 
analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when 
the nodes in the graph describe jointly Gaussian random variables. We 
give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with 
those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions 
for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges it gives 
the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks 
with a single loop.
