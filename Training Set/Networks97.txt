"i-tee: A fully automated Cyber Defense Competition for Students." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015.
We present an Intelligent Training Exercise Environment (itee1 ), a fully automated Cyber Defense Competition platform. The main features of i-tee are: automated attacks, automated scoring with immediate feedback using a scoreboard, and background traffic generation. The main advantage of the platform is easy integration into existing curricula and suitability for continuous education as well as on-site training at companies. The platform implements a modular approach called learning spaces for implementing different competitions and hands-on labs. The platform is highly automated to enable execution with up to 30 teams by one person using a single server. The platform is publicly available under MIT license.
