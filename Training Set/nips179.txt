"Dynamically Adapting Kernels in Support Vector Machines." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
The kernel-parameter is one of the few tunable parameters in Sup- 
port Vector machines, controlling the complexity of the resulting 
hypothesis. Its choice amounts to model selection and its value is 
usually found by means of a validation set. We present an algo- 
rithm which can automatically perform model selection with little 
additional computational cost and with no need of a validation set. 
In this procedure model selection and learning are not separate, 
but kernels are dynamically adjusted during the learning process 
to find the kernel parameter which provides the best possible upper 
bound on the generalisation error. Theoretical results motivating 
the approach and experimental results confirming its validity are 
presented.
