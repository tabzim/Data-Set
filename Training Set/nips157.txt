"Utilizing lime: Asynchronous Binding." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.
Historically, connectionist systems have not excelled at represent- 
ing and manipulating complex structures. How can a system com- 
posed of simple neuron-like computing elements encode complex 
relations? Recently, researchers have begun to appreciate that rep- 
resentations can extend in both time and space. Many researchers 
have proposed that the synchronous firing of units can encode com- 
plex representations. I identify the limitations of this approach 
and present an asynchronous model of binding that effectively rep- 
resents complex structures. The asynchronous model extends the 
synchronous approach. I argue that our cognitive architecture uti- 
lizes a similar mechanism.
