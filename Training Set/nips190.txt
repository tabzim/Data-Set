"A Precise Characterization of the Class of Languages Recognized by Neural Nets under Gaussian and other Common Noise Distributions." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We consider recurrent analog neural nets where each gate is subject to 
Gaussian noise, or any other common noise distribution whose probabil- 
ity density function is nonzero on a large set. We show that many regular 
languages cannot be recognized by networks of this type, for example 
the language {w C {0, 1}* I w begins with 0}, and we give a precise 
characterization of those languages which can be recognized. This result 
implies severe constraints on possibilities for constructing recurrent ana- 
log neural nets that are robust against realistic types of analog noise. On 
the other hand we present a method for constructingfeedforward analog 
neural nets that are robust with regard to analog noise of this type.
