"Short vs. long flows: a battle that both can win." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015.
In this paper, we introduce MMPTCP, a novel transport protocol which aims at unifying the way data is transported in data centres. MMPTCP runs in two phases; initially, it randomly scatters packets in the network under a single congestion window exploiting all available paths. This is beneficial to latency-sensitive flows. During the second phase, MMPTCP runs in Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) mode, which has been shown to be very efficient for long flows. Initial evaluation shows that our approach significantly improves short flow completion times while providing high throughput for long flows and high overall network utilisation.
