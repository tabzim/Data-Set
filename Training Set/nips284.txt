"USING COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE TO ROUTE INTERNET TRAFFIC." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
A COllective INtelligence (COIN) is a set of interacting reinforce- 
ment learning (RL) algorithms designed in an automated fashion 
so that their collective behavior optimizes a global utility function. 
We summarize the theory of COINs, then present experiments us- 
ing that theory to design COINs to control internet traffic routing. 
These experiments indicate that COINs outperform all previously 
investigated RL-based, shortest path routing algorithms.
