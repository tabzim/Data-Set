"The Belief in TAP Yoshiyuki Kabashima." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
We show the similarity between belief propagation and TAP, for 
decoding corrupted messages encoded by Sourlas's method. The 
latter is a special case of the Gallager error-correcting code, where 
the code word comprises products of Ix' bits selected randomly from 
the original message. We examine the efficacy of solutions obtained 
by the two methods for various values of Ix' and show that solutions 
for I( > 3 may be sensitive to the choice of initial conditions in 
the case of unbiased patterns. Good approximations are obtained 
generally for I, = 2 and for biased patterns in the case of Ix' > 3, 
especially when Nishimori's temperature is being used.
