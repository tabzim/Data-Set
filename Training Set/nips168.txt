"Spike-based compared to rate-based Hebbian learning." Advances in neural information processing systems. 1999.
A correlation-based learning rule at the spike level is formulated, 
mathematically analyzed, and compared to learning in a firing-rate 
description. A differential equation for the learning dynamics is 
derived under the assumption that the time scales of learning and 
spiking can be separated. For a linear Poissonian neuron model 
which receives time-dependent stochastic input we show that spike 
correlations on a millisecond time scale play indeed a role. Corre- 
lations between input and output spikes tend to stabilize structure 
formation, provided that the form of the learning window is in 
accordance with Hebb's principle. Conditions for an intrinsic nor- 
malization of the average synaptic weight are discussed.
