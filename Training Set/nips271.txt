"Adding Constrained Discontinuities to Gaussian Process Models of Wind Fields." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
Gaussian Processes provide good prior models for spatial data, but can 
be too smooth. In many physical situations there are discontinuities 
along bounding surfaces, for example fronts in near-surface wind fields. 
We describe a modelling method for such a constrained discontinuity 
and demonstrate how to infer the model parameters in wind fields with 
MCMC sampling.
