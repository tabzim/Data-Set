"The effect of correlations on the Fisher information of population codes." Advances in neural information processing systems. 1999.
We study the effect of correlated noise on the accuracy of popu- 
lation coding using a model of a population of neurons that are 
broadly tuned to an angle in two-dimension. The fluctuations in 
he neuronat activity is modeled as a Gaussian noise with pairwise 
correlations which decays exponentially with the difference between 
the preferred orientations of the pair. By calculating the Fisher in- 
formation of the system, we show that in the biologically relevant 
regime of parameters positive correlations decrease the estimation 
capability of the network relative to the uncorrelated population. 
Moreover strong positive correlations result in information capac- 
ity which saturates to a finite value as the number of cells in the 
population grows. In contrast, negative correlations substantially 
increase the information capacity of the neuronal population.
