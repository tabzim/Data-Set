"Global Optimisation of Neural Network Models Via Sequential Sampling." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We propose a novel strategy for training neural networks using se- 
quential sampling-importance resampling algorithms. This global 
optimisation strategy allows us to learn the probability distribu- 
tion of the network weights in a sequential framework. It is well 
suited to applications involving on-line, nonlinear, non-Gaussian or 
non-stationary signal processing.
