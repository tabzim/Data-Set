 "Scalable pattern matching over compressed graphs via dedensification." Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. ACM, 2016.
One of the most common operations on graph databases is graph pattern matching (e.g., graph isomorphism and more general types of “subgraph pattern matching”). In fact, in some graph query languages every single query is expressed as a graph matching operation. Consequently, there has been a signi?cant amount of research e?ort in optimizing graph matching operations in graph database systems. As graph databases have scaled in recent years, so too has recent work on scaling graph matching operations. However, the performance of recent proposals for scaling graph pattern matching is limited by the presence of high-degree nodes. These high-degree nodes result in an explosion of intermediate result sizes during query execution, and therefore signi?cant performance bottlenecks. In this paper we present a de-densi?cation technique that losslessly compresses the neighborhood around high-degree nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a query processing technique that enables direct operation of graph query processing operations over the com-pressed data, without ever having to decompress the data. For pattern matching operations, we show how this technique can be implemented as a layer above existing graph database systems, so that the end-user can bene?t from this technique without requiring modi?cations to the core graph database engine code. Our technique reduces the size of the intermediate result sets during query processing, and thereby improves query performance.
