"Graded grammaticality in Prediction Fractal Machines."Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
We introduce a novel method of constructing language models, 
which avoids some of the problems associated with recurrent neu- 
ral networks. The method of creating a Prediction Fractal Machine 
(PFM) [1] is briefly described and some experiments are presented 
which demonstrate the suitability of PFMs for language modeling. 
PFMs distinguish reliably between minimal pairs, and their be- 
havior is consistent with the hypothesis [4] that wellformedness is 
'graded' not absolute. A discussion of their potential to offer fresh 
insights into language acquisition and processing follows.
