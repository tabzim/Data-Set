"Bayesian model selection for Support Vector machines, Gaussian processes and other kernel classifiers." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
We present a variational Bayesian method for model selection over 
families of kernels classifiers like Support Vector machines or Gaus- 
sian processes. The algorithm needs no user interaction and is able 
to adapt a large number of kernel parameters to given data without 
having to sacrifice training cases for validation. This opens the pos- 
sibility to use sophisticated families of kernels in situations where 
the small "standard kernel" classes are clearly inappropriate. We 
relate the method to other work done on Gaussian processes and 
clarify the relation between Support Vector machines and certain 
Gaussian process models.
