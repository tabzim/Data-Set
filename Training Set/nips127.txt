"Learning Informative Statistics: A Nonparametric Approach." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We discuss an information theoretic approach for categorizing and mod- 
eling dynamic processes. The approach can learn a compact and informa- 
tive statistic which summarizes past states to predict future observations. 
Furthermore, the uncertainty of the prediction is characterized nonpara- 
metrically by a joint density over the learned statistic and present obser- 
vation. We discuss the application of the technique to both noise driven 
dynamical systems and random processes sampled from a density which 
is conditioned on the past. In the first case we show results in which both 
the dynamics of random walk and the statistics of the driving noise are 
captured. In the second case we present results in which a summarizing 
statistic is learned on noisy random telegraph waves with differing de- 
pendencies on past states. In both cases the algorithm yields a principled 
approach for discriminating processes with differing dynamics and/or de- 
pendencies. The method is grounded in ideas from information theory 
and nonparametric statistics.
