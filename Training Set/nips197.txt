"Shrinking the Tube: A New Support Vector Regression Algorithm." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
A new algorithm for Support Vector regression is described. For a priori 
chosen , it automatically adjusts a flexible tube of minimal radius to the 
data such that at most a fraction  of the data points lie outside. More- 
over, it is shown how to use parametric tube shapes with non-constant 
radius. The algorithm is analysed theoretically and experimentally.
