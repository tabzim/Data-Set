"Semiparametric Approach to Multichannel Blind Deconvolution of Nonminimum Phase Systems." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
In this paper we discuss the semiparametric statistical model for blind 
deconvolution. First we introduce a Lie Group to the manifold of non- 
causal FIR filters. Then blind deconvolution problem is formulated in 
the framework of a semiparametric model, and a family of estimating 
functions is derived for blind deconvolution. A natural gradient learn- 
ing algorithm is developed for training noncausal filters. Stability of the 
natural gradient algorithm is also analyzed in this framework.
