"Distributional population codes and multiple motion models." Advances in neural information processing systems. 1999.
Most theoretical and empirical studies of population codes make 
the assumption that underlying neuronal activities is a unique and 
unambiguous value of an encoded quantity. However, population 
activities can contain additional information about such things as 
multiple values of or uncertainty about the quantity. We have pre- 
viously suggested a method to recover extra information by treat- 
ing the activities of the population of cells as coding for a com- 
plete distribution over the coded quantity rather than just a single 
value. We now show how this approach bears on psychophys- 
ical and neurophysiological studies of population codes for mo- 
tion direction in tasks involving transparent motion stimuli. We 
show that, unlike standard approaches, it is able to recover mul- 
tiple motions from population responses, and also that its output 
is consistent with both correct and erroneous human performance 
on psychophysical tasks.
