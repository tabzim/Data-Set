"Analyzing and visualizing single-trial event-related potentials." Advances in neural information processing systems. 1999.
Event-related potentials (ERPs), are portions of electroencephalo- 
graphic (EEG) recordings that are both time- and phase-locked 
to experimental events. ERPs are usually averaged to increase 
their signal/noise ratio relative to non-phase locked EEG activ- 
ity, regardless of the fact that response activity in single epochs 
may vary widely in time course and scalp distribution. This study 
applies a linear decomposition tool, Independent Component Anal- 
ysis (ICA) [1], to multichannel single-trial EEG records to derive 
spatial filters that decompose single-trial EEG epochs into a sum 
of temporally independent and spatially fixed components arising 
from distinct or overlapping brain or extra-brain networks. Our 
results on normal and autistic subjects show that ICA can sep- 
arate artifactual, stimulus-locked, response-locked, anal non-event 
related background EEG activities into separate components, al- 
lowing (1) removal of pervasive artifacts of all types from single-trial 
EEG records, and (2) identification of both stimulus- and response- 
locked EEG components. Second, this study proposes a new visual- 
ization tool, the 'ERP image', for investigating variability in laten- 
cies and amplitudes of event-evoked responses in spontaneous EEG 
or MEG records. We show that sorting single-trial ERP epochs in 
order of reaction time and plotting the potentials in 2-D clearly 
reveals underlying patterns of response variability linked to per- 
formance. These analysis and visualization tools appear broadly 
applicable to electrophyiological research on both normal and clin- 
ical populations.
