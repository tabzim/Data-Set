"Overcoming key weaknesses of distance-based neighbourhood methods using a data dependent dissimilarity measure." Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. ACM, 2016.
This paper introduces the ﬁrst generic version of data dependent dissimilarity and shows that it provides a better closest match than distance measures for three existing algorithms in clustering, anomaly detection and multi-label classiﬁcation. For each algorithm, we show that by simply replacing the distance measure with the data dependent dissimilarity measure, it overcomes a key weakness of the otherwise unchanged algorithm.
