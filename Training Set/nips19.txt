"Distributed Synchrony of Spiking Neurons in a Hebbian Cell Assembly." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We investigate the behavior of a Hebbian cell assembly of spiking 
neurons formed via a temporal synaptic learning curve. This learn- 
ing function is based on recent experimental findings. It includes 
potentiation for short time delays between pre- and post-synaptic 
neuronal spiking, and depression for spiking events occuring in the 
reverse order. The coupling between the dynamics of the synaptic 
learning and of the neuronal activation leads to interesting results. 
We find that the cell assembly can fire asynchronously, but may 
also function in complete synchrony, or in distributed synchrony. 
The latter implies spontaneous division of the Hebbian cell assem- 
bly into groups of cells that fire in a cyclic manner. We invetigate 
the behavior of distributed synchrony both by simulations and by 
analytic calculations of the resulting synaptic distributions.
