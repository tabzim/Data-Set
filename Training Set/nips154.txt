"A Model for Associative Multiplication G. BjSrn Christianson* Department of Psychology McMaster University Hamilton, Ont. L8S 4K1."
Despite the fact that mental arithmetic is based on only a few hun- 
dred basic facts and some simple algorithms, humans have a diffi- 
cult time mastering the subject, and even experienced individuals 
make mistakes. Associative multiplication, the process of doing 
multiplication by memory without the use of rules or algorithms, 
is especially problematic. Humans exhibit certain characteristic 
phenomena in performing associative multiplications, both in the 
type of error and in the error frequency. We propose a model for 
the process of associative multiplication, and compare its perfor- 
mance in both these phenomena with data from normal humans 
and from the model proposed by Anderson et al (1994).
