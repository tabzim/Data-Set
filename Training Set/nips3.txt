"Effects of Spatial and Temporal Contiguity on the Acquisition of Spatial Information." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
Spatial information comes in two forms: direct spatial information (for 
example, retinal position) and indirect temporal contiguity information, 
since objects encountered sequentially are in general spatially close. The 
acquisition of spatial information by a neural network is investigated 
here. Given a spatial layout of several objects, networks are trained on a 
prediction task. Networks using temporal sequences with no direct spa- 
tial information are found to develop internal representations that show 
distances correlated with distances in the external layout. The influence 
of spatial information is analyzed by providing direct spatial information 
to the system during training that is either consistent with the layout or 
inconsistent with it. This approach allows examination of the relative 
contributions of spatial and temporal contiguity.
