"Coordinate Transformation Learning of Hand Position Feedback Controller by Using Change of Position Error Norm." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
In order to grasp an object, we need to solve the inverse kine- 
matics problem, i.e., the coordinate transformation from the visual 
coordinates to the joint angle vector coordinates of the arm. Al- 
though several models of coordinate transformation learning have 
been proposed, they suffer from a number of drawbacks. In human 
motion control, the learning of the hand position error feedback 
controller in the inverse kinematics solver is important. This paper 
proposes a novel model of the coordinate transformation learning 
of the human visual feedback controller that uses the change of 
the joint angle vector and the corresponding change of the square 
of the hand position error norm. The feasibility of the proposed 
model is illustrated using numerical simulations.
