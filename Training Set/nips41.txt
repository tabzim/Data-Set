"Statistical Dynamics of Batch Learning." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
An important issue in neural computing concerns the description of 
learning dynamics with macroscopic dynamical variables. Recen- 
t progress on on-line learning only addresses the often unrealistic 
case of an infinite training set. We introduce a new framework to 
model batch learning of restricted sets of examples, widely applica- 
ble to any learning cost function, and fully taking into account the 
temporal correlations introduced by the recycling of the examples. 
For illustration we analyze the effects of weight decay and early 
stopping during the learning of teacher-generated examples.
