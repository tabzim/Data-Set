"Beyond the stars: Revisiting virtual cluster embeddings." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 45.3 (2015): 12-18.
It is well-known that cloud application performance can critically depend on the network. Over the last years, several systems have been developed which provide the application with the illusion of a virtual cluster : a star-shaped virtual network topology connecting virtual machines to a logical switch with absolute bandwidth guarantees. In this paper, we debunk some of the myths around the virtual cluster embedding problem. First, we show that the virtual cluster embedding problem is not NP-hard, and present the fast and optimal embedding algorithm VC-ACE for arbitrary datacenter topologies. Second, we argue that resources may be wasted by enforcing star-topology embeddings, and alternatively promote a hose embedding approach. We discuss the computational complexity of hose embeddings and derive the HVC-ACE algorithm. Using simulations we substantiate the benefits of hose embeddings in terms of acceptance ratio and resource footprint.
