"Speech Modelling Using Subspace and EM Techniques." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
The speech waveform can be modelled as a piecewise-stationary linear 
stochastic state space system, and its parameters can be estimated using 
an expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. One problem is the ini- 
tialisation of the EM algorithm. Standard initialisation schemes can lead 
to poor formant trajectories. But these trajectories however are impor- 
tant for vowel intelligibility. The aim of this paper is to investigate the 
suitability of subspace identification methods to initialise EM. 
The paper compares the subspace state space system identification 
(4SID) method with the EM algorithm. The 4SID and EM methods are 
similar in that they both estimate a state sequence (but using Kalman fil- 
ters and Kalman smoothers respectively), and then estimate parameters 
(but using least-squares and maximum likelihood respectively). The sim- 
ilarity of 4SID and EM motivates the use of 4SID to initialise EM. Also, 
4SID is non-iterative and requires no initialisation, whereas EM is itera- 
tive and requires initialisation. However 4SID is sub-optimal compared 
to EM in a probabilistic sense. During experiments on real speech, 4SID 
methods compare favourably with conventional initialisation techniques. 
They produce smoother formant trajectories, have greater frequency res- 
olution, and produce higher likelihoods.
