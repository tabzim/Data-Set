"Example Based Image Synthesis of Articulated Figures." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We present a method for learning complex appearance mappings, such 
as occur with images of articulated objects. Traditional interpolation 
networks fail on this case since appearance is not necessarily a smooth 
function nor a linear manifold for articulated objects. We define an ap- 
pearance mapping from examples by constructing a set of independently 
smooth interpolation networks; these networks can cover overlapping re- 
gions of parameter space. A set growing procedure is used to find ex- 
ample clusters which are well-approximated within their convex hull; 
interpolation then proceeds only within these sets of examples. With this 
method physically valid images are produced even in regions of param- 
eter space where nearby examples have different appearances. We show 
results generating both simulated and real arm images.
