"Computational Differences between Asymmetrical and Symmetrical Networks." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
Symmetrically connected recurrent networks have recently been 
used as models of a host of neural computations. However, be- 
cause of the separation between excitation and inhibition, biolog- 
ical neural networks are asymmetrical. We study characteristic 
differences between asymmetrical networks and their symmetri- 
cal counterparts, showing that they have dramatically different 
dynamical behavior and also how the differences can be exploited 
for computational ends. We illustrate our results in the case of a 
network that is a selective amplifier.
