"Kirchoff Law Markov Fields for Analog Circuit Design." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Three contributions to developing an algorithm for assisting engi- 
neers in designing analog circuits are provided in this paper. First, 
a method for representing highly nonlinear and non-continuous 
analog circuits using Kirchoff current law potential functions within 
the context of a Markov field is described. Second, a relatively effi- 
cient algorithm for optimizing the Markov field objective function 
is briefly described and the convergence proof is briefly sketched. 
And third, empirical results illustrating the strengths and limita- 
tions of the approach are provided within the context of a JFET 
transistor design problem. The proposed algorithm generated a set 
of circuit components for the JFET circuit model that accurately 
generated the desired characteristic curves.
