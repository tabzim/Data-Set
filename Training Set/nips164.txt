"Neuronal regulation: A mechanism for synaptic pruning during brain maturation." Neural computation 11.8 (1999): 2061-2080.
Human and animal studies show that mammalian brain undergoes 
massive synaptic pruning during childhood, removing about half of 
the synapses until puberty. We have previously shown that main- 
taining network memory performance while synapses are deleted, 
requires that synapses are properly modified and pruned, remov- 
ing the weaker synapses. We now show that neuronal regulation, a 
mechanism recently observed to maintain the average neuronal in- 
put field, results in weight-dependent synaptic modification. Under 
the correct range of the degradation dimension and synaptic up- 
per bound, neuronal regulation removes the weaker synapses and 
judiciously modifies the remaining synapses. It implements near 
optimal synaptic modification, and maintains the memory perfor- 
mance of a network undergoing massive synaptic pruning. Thus, 
this paper shows that in addition to the known effects of Hebbian 
changes, neuronal regulation may play an important role in the 
self-organization of brain networks during development.
