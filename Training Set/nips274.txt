"Fast Neural Network Emulation of Dynamical Systems for Computer Animation." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
Computer animation through the numerical simulation of physics-based 
graphics models offers unsurpassed realism, but it can be computation- 
ally demanding. This paper demonstrates the possibility of replacing the 
numerical simulation of nontrivial dynamic models with a dramatically 
more efficient "NeuroAnimator" that exploits neural networks. Neu- 
roAnimators are automatically trained off-line to emulate physical dy- 
namics through the observation of physics-based models in action. De- 
pending on the model, its neural network emulator can yield physically 
realistic animation one or two orders of magnitude faster than conven- 
tional numerical simulation. We demonstrate NeuroAnimators for a va- 
riety of physics-based models.
