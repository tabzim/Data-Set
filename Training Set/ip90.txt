"Two-stage exclusion of angular intra prediction modes for fast mode decision in HEVC." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
The latest video compression standard HEVC sets new benchmarks concerning the efficiency for both video coding and also still image coding, i.e., pure intra picture coding. Nevertheless, its high complexity created by the rate-distortion optimization procedure is a serious drawback. To reduce this computational burden, several algorithms for fast mode decision have been proposed. However, most of these methods exclude modes based on analyzing the respective prediction errors. In this paper we present an algorithm for individual angular prediction mode exclusion which intervenes earlier, namely before prediction, almost solely based on the analysis of the reference samples. It is proposed to use this approach as an extension of the global angular intra mode exclusion scheme based on the reference samples from our previous work. The combined algorithm achieves average encoding time savings of approximately 25%, accompanied by only about 1.0% bit rate increase.
