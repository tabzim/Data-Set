"An Improved Decomposition Algorithm for Regression Support Vector Machines." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
A new decomposition algorithm for training regression Support 
Vector Machines (SVM) is presented. The algorithm builds on 
the basic principles of decomposition proposed by Osuna et. al., 
and addresses the issue of optimal working set selection. The new 
criteria for testing optimality of a working set are derived. Based 
on these criteria, the principle of "maximal inconsistency" is pro- 
posed to form (approximately) optimal working sets. Experimental 
results show superior performance of the new algorithm in compar- 
ison with traditional training of regression SVM without decompo- 
sition. Similar results have been previously reported on decomposi- 
tion algorithms for pattern recognition SVM. The new algorithm is 
also applicable to advanced SVM formulations based on regression, 
such as density estimation and integral equation SVM.
