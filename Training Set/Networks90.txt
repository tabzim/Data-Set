"Towards the 5g revolution: A software defined network architecture exploiting network coding as a service." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015.
Many networking visioners agree that 5G will be much more than the incremental improvement, in terms of data rate, of 4G. Besides the mobile networks, 5G will fundamentally influence the core infrastructure as well. In our vision the realization of the challenging promises of 5G (e.g. extremely fast, low-overhead, low-delay access of mostly cloudified services and content) will require the massive use of multipathing equipped with low overhead transport solutions tailored to fast, reliable and secure data retrieval from cloud architectures. In this demo we present a prototype architecture supporting such services by making use of automatically configured multipath service chains implementing network coding based transport solutions over off-the-shelf software defined networking (SDN) components.
