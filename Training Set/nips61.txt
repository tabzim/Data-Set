"The Nonnegative Boltzmann Machine." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
The nonnegative Boltzmann machine (NNBM) is a recurrent neural net- 
work model that can describe multimodal nonnegative data. Application 
of maximum likelihood estimation to this model gives a learning rule that 
is analogous to the binary Boltzmann machine. We examine the utility of 
the mean field approximation for the NNBM, and describe how Monte 
Carlo sampling techniques can be used to learn its parameters. Reflec- 
tive slice sampling is particularly well-suited for this distribution, and 
can efficiently be implemented to sample the distribution. We illustrate 
learning of the NNBM on a translationally invariant distribution, as well 
as on a generative model for images of human faces.
