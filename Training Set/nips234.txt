"Probabilistic Visualisation of High-dimensional Binary Data." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
We present a probabilistic latent-variable framework for data visu- 
alisation, a key feature of which is its applicability to binary and 
categorical data types for which few established methods exist. A 
variational approximation to the likelihood is exploited to derive a 
fast algorithm for determining the model parameters. Illustrations 
of application to real and synthetic binary data sets are given.
