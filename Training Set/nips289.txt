"Viewing Classifier Systems as Model Free Learning in POMDPs Akira Hayashi and Nobuo Suematsu Faculty of Information Sciences." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
Classifier systems are now viewed disappointing because of their prob- 
lems such as the rule strength vs rule set performance problem and the 
credit assignment problem. In order to solve the problems, we have de- 
veloped a hybrid classifier system: GLS (Generalization Learning Sys- 
tem). In designing GLS, we view CSs as model free learning in POMDPs 
and take a hybrid approach to finding the best generalization, given the 
total number of rules. GLS uses the policy improvement procedure by 
Jaakkola et al. for an locally optimal stochastic policy when a set of 
rule conditions is given. GLS uses GA to search for the best set of rule 
conditions.
