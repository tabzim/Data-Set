End-user mapping: Next generation request routing for content delivery." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015.
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) deliver much of the world's web, video, and application content on the Internet today. A key component of a CDN is the mapping system that uses the DNS protocol to route each client's request to a "proximal" server that serves the requested content. While traditional mapping systems identify a client using the IP of its name server, we describe our experience in building and rollingout a novel system called end-user mapping that identifies the client directly by using a prefix of the client's IP address. Using measurements from Akamai's production network during the roll-out, we show that end-user mapping provides significant performance benefits for clients who use public resolvers, including an eight-fold decrease in mapping distance, a two-fold decrease in RTT and content download time, and a 30% improvement in the time-to-first-byte. We also quantify the scaling challenges in implementing enduser mapping such as the 8-fold increase in DNS queries. Finally, we show that a CDN with a larger number of deployment locations is likely to benefit more from end-user mapping than a CDN with a smaller number of deployments.
