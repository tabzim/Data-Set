"Finite-dimensional approximation of Gaussian processes." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
Gaussian process (GP) prediction suffers from O(n 3) scaling with the 
data set size n. By using a finite-dimensional basis to approximate the 
GP predictor, the computational complexity can be reduced. We de- 
rive optimal finite-dimensional predictors under a number of assump- 
tions, and show the superiority of these predictors over the Projected 
Bayes Regression method (which is asymptotically optimal). We also 
show how to calculate the minimal model size for a given n. The 
calculations are backed up by numerical experiments.
