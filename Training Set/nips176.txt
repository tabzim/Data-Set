"Tractable variational structures for approximating graphical models." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
Graphical models provide a broad probabilistic flamework with ap- 
plications in speech recognition (Hidden Markov Models), medical 
diagnosis (Belief networks) and artificial intelligence (Boltzmann 
Machines). However, the computing time is typically exponential 
in the number of nodes in the graph. Within the variational flame- 
work for approximating these models, we present two classes of dis- 
tributions, decimatable Boltzmann Machines and Tractable Belief 
Networks that go beyond the standard factorized approach. We 
give generalised mean-field equations for both these directed and 
undirected approximations. Simulation results on a small bench- 
mark problem suggest using these richer approximations compares 
favorably against others previously reported in the literature.
