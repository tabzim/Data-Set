Calcium (Ca'+)is an ubiquitous intracellular messenger which reg- 
ulates cellular processes, such as secretion, contraction, and cell 
proliferation. A number of different cell types respond to hormonal 
stimuli with periodic oscillations of the intracellular free calcium 
concentration ([Ca'+]i). These Ca '+ signals are often organized 
in complex temporal and spatial patterns even under conditions 
of sustained stimulation. Here we study the spario-temporal as- 
pects of intracellular calcium ([Ca'+]i) oscillations in clonal 3-cells 
(hamster insulin secreting cells, HIT) under pharmacological stim- 
ulation (SchSfl et al., 1996). We use a novel fast fixed-point al- 
gorithm (Hyv/irinen and Oja, 1997) for Independent Component 
Analysis (ICA) to blind source separation of the spario-temporal 
dynamics of [Ca'+]i in a HIT-cell. Using this approach we find two 
significant independent components out of five differently mixed in- 
put signals: one [Ca'+]i signal with a mean oscillatory period of 
68s and a high frequency signal with a broadband power spectrum 
with considerable spectral density. This results is in good agree- 
ment with a study on high-frequency [Ca'+]i oscillations (PaluS 
et al., 1998) Further theoretical and experimental studies have to 
be performed to resolve the question on the functional impact of 
intracellular signaling of these independent [Ca'+]i signals.
