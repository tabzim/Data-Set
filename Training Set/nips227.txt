"Very Fast EM-based Mixture Model Clustering using Multiresolution kd-trees." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
Clustering is important in many fields ilcluding nanufac[uring, 
biology, finance, and astronolny. Mixt. ure models are a popular ap- 
proach due to their st. atist. ical foundat. ions, and EM is a very pop- 
ular method for finding mixt. ure models. EM, however, requires 
many accesses of the data, and thus has been di.missed as imprac- 
tical (e.g. [.9]) for data mining of enormous dat, aset.s. We present a 
new algorit. hm, based on the nmltiresolut. ion/cd-trees of [5], which 
dramatically reduces the cost of EM-based clustering, wit, h savings 
rising linearly with the nmnber of datapoints. Although present. ed 
here for maxinmm likelihood est. imat.ion of Gaussian mixt, ure mod- 
els, it, isalso applicable t.o non-(4aussian models (provided class 
densit.ies are monotonic in Mahalanobis dist, ance), mixed categori- 
cal/nnmeric (:lust. ers. and Bayesian met. hods such as Autoclass [1].
