"A Neuromorphic Monaural Sound Localizer." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
We describe the first single microphone sound localization system 
and its inspiration from theories of human monaural sound localiza- 
tion. Reflections and diffractions caused by the external ear (pinna) 
allow humans to estimate sound source elevations using only one 
ear. Our single microphone localization model relies on a specially 
shaped reflecting structure that serves the role of the pinna. Spe- 
cially designed analog VLSI circuitry uses echo-time processing to 
localize the sound. A CMOS integrated circuit has been designed, 
fabricated, and successfully demonstrated on actual sounds.
