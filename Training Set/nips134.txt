"Application of Blind Separation of Sources to Optical Recording of Brain Activity." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
In the analysis of data recorded by optical imaging from intrinsic signals 
(measurement of changes of light reflectance from cortical tissue) the re- 
moval of noise and artifacts such as blood vessel patterns is a serious 
problem. Often bandpass filtering is used, but the underlying assumption 
that a spatial frequency exists, which separates the mapping component 
from other components (especially the global signal), is questionable. 
Here we propose alternative ways of processing optical imaging data, us- 
ing blind source separation techniques based on the spatial decorrelation 
of the data. We first perform benchmarks on artificial data in order to 
select the way of processing, which is most robust with respect to sen- 
sor noise. We then apply it to recordings of optical imaging experiments 
from macaque primary visual cortex. We show that our BSS technique is 
able to extract ocular dominance and orientation preference maps from 
single condition stacks, for data, where standard post-processing pro- 
cedures fail. Artifacts, especially blood vessel patterns, can often be 
completely removed from the maps. In summary, our method for blind 
source separation using extended spatial decorrelation is a superior tech- 
nique for the analysis of optical recording data.
