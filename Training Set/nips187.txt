"Inference in Multilayer Networks via Large Deviation Bounds." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We study probabilistic inference in large, layered Bayesian net- 
works represented as directed acyclic graphs. We show that the 
intractability of exact inference in such networks does not preclude 
their effective use. We give algorithms for approximate probabilis- 
tic inference that exploit averaging phenomena occurring at nodes 
with large numbers of parents. We show that these algorithms 
compute rigorous lower and upper bounds on marginal probabili- 
ties of interest, prove that these bounds become exact in the limit 
of large networks, and provide rates of convergence.
