"Convergence of The Wake-Sleep Algorithm." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
The W-S (Wake-Sleep) algorithm is a simple learning rule for the models 
with hidden variables. It is shown that this algorithm can be applied to 
a factor analysis model which is a linear version of the Helmholtz ma- 
chine. But even for a factor analysis model, the general convergence is 
not proved theoretically. In this article, we describe the geometrical un- 
derstanding of the W-S algorithm in contrast with the EM (Expectation- 
Maximization) algorithm and the era algorithm. As the result, we prove 
the convergence of the W-S algorithm for the factor analysis model. We 
also show the condition for the convergence in general models.
