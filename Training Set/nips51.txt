"Algebraic Analysis for Non-Regular Learning Machines." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Hierarchical learning machines are non-regular and non-identifiable 
statistical models, whose true parameter sets are analytic sets with 
singularities. Using algebraic analysis, we rigorously prove that 
the stochastic complexity of a non-identifiable learning machine 
is asymptotically equal to Allogn- (ml - 1)loglogn q-const., 
where n is the number of training samples. Moreover we show that 
the rational number A1 and the integer ml can be algorithmically 
calculated using resolution of singularities in algebraic geometry. 
Also we obtain inequalities 0  /1  d/2 and I _< ml _< d, where d 
is the number of parameters.
