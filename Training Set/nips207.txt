"Fisher Scoring and a Mixture of Modes Approach for Approximate Inference and Learning in Nonlinear State Space Models." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We present Monte-Carlo generalized EM equations for learning in non- 
linear state space models. The difficulties lie in the Monte-Carlo E-step 
which consists of sampling from the posterior distribution of the hidden 
variables given the observations. The new idea presented in this paper is 
to generate samples from a Gaussian approximation to the true posterior 
from which it is easy to obtain independent samples. The parameters of 
the Gaussian approximation are either derived from the extended Kalman 
filter or the Fisher scoring algorithm. In case the posterior density is mul- 
timodal we propose to approximate the posterior by a sum of Gaussians 
(mixture of modes approach). We show that sampling from the approxi- 
mate posterior densities obtained by the above algorithms leads to better 
models than using point estimates for the hidden states. In our exper- 
iment, the Fisher scoring algorithm obtained a better approximation of 
the posterior mode than the EKF. For a multimodal distribution, the mix- 
ture of modes approach gave superior results.
