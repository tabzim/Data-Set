"Markov processes on curves for automatic speech recognition." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We investigate a probabilistic framework for automatic speech 
recognition based on the intrinsic geometric properties of curves. 
In particular, we analyze the setting in which two variables--one 
continuous (a), one discrete (s)--evolve jointly in time. We sup- 
pose that the vector a traces out a smooth multidimensional curve 
and that the variable s evolves stochastically as a function of the 
arc length traversed along this curve. Since arc length does not 
depend on the rate at which a curve is traversed, this gives rise 
to a family of Markov processes whose predictions, Pr[sla], are 
invariant to nonlinear warpings of time. We describe the use of 
such models, known as Markov processes on curves (MPCs), for 
automatic speech recognition, where a are acoustic feature trajec- 
tories and s are phonetic transcriptions. On two tasks--recognizing 
New Jersey town names and connected alpha-digits--we find that 
MPCs yield lower word error rates than comparably trained hidden 
Markov models.
