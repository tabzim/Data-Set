"Bifurcation Analysis of a Silicon Neuron." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We have developed a VLSI silicon neuron and a corresponding mathe- 
matical model that is a two state-variable system. We describe the cir- 
cuit implementation and compare the behaviors observed in the silicon 
neuron and the mathematical model. We also perform bifurcation analy- 
sis of the mathematical model by varying the externally applied current 
and show that the behaviors exhibited by the silicon neuron under corre- 
sponding conditions are in good agreement to those predicted by the 
bifurcation analysis.
