"Maximum Conditional Likelihood via Bound Maximization and the CEM Algorithm." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
We present the CEM (Conditional œxpectation Maximization) al- 
gorithm as an extension of the EM (œxpectation Maximization) 
algorithm to conditional density estimation under missing data. A 
bounding and maximization process is given to specifically optimize 
conditional likelihood instead of the usual joint likelihood. We ap- 
ply the method to conditioned mixture models and use bounding 
techniques to derive the models update rules. Monotonic conver- 
gence, computational efficiency and regression results superior to 
EM are demonstrated.
