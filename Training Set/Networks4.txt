"It's a match!: Near-optimal and incremental middlebox deployment." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 46.1 (2016): 30-36.
The virtualization and softwarization of modern computer networks o?ers new opportunities for the simpli?ed management and ?exible placement of middleboxes as e.g. ?rewalls and proxies. This paper initiates the study of algorithmically exploiting the ?exibilities present in virtualized and software-de?ned networks. Particularly, we are interested in the initial as well as the incremental deployment of middleboxes. We present a deterministic O(log(min{n, ?})) approximation algorithm for n-node computer networks, where ? is the middlebox capacity. The algorithm is based on optimizing over a submodular function which can be computed e?ciently using a fast augmenting path approach. The derived approximation bound is optimal: the underlying problem is computationally hard to approximate within sublogarithmic factors, unless P = NP holds. We additionally present an exact algorithm based on integer programming, and complement our formal analysis with simulations. In particular, we consider the number of used middleboxes and highlight the bene?ts of the approximation algorithm in incremental deployments. Our approach also ?nds interesting applications, e.g., in the context of incremental deployment of software-de?ned networks.
