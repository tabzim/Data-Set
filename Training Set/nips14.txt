"Effective Learning Requires Neuronal Remodeling of Hebbian Synapses." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
This paper revisits the classical neuroscience paradigm of Hebbian 
learning. We find that a necessary requirement for effective as- 
sociative memory learning is that the efcacies of the incoming 
synapses should be uncorrelated. This requirement is difficult to 
achieve in a robust manner by Hebbian synaptic learning, since it 
depends on network level information. Effective learning can yet be 
obtained by a neuronal process that maintains a zero sum of the in- 
coming synaptic efcacies. This normalization drastically improves 
the memory capacity of associative networks, from an essentially 
bounded capacity to one that linearly scales with the network's size. 
It also enables the effective storage of patterns with heterogeneous 
coding levels in a single network. Such neuronal normalization can 
be successfully carried out by activity-dependent homeostasis of the 
neuron's synaptic efcacies, which was recently observed in cortical 
tissue. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that effective associa- 
tive learning with Hebbian synapses alone is biologically implausi- 
ble and that Hebbian synapses must be continuously remodeled by 
neuronally-driven regulatory processes in the brain.
