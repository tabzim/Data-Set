A figure-ground segregation network is proposed based on a novel 
boundary pair representation. Nodes in the network are bound- 
ary segments obtained through local grouping. Each node is ex- 
citatorily coupled with the neighboring nodes that belong to the 
same region, and inhibitorily coupled with the corresponding paired 
node. Gestalt grouping rules are incorporated by modulating con- 
nections. The status of a node represents its probability being 
figural and is updated according to a differential equation. The 
system solves the figure-ground segregation problem through tem- 
poral evolution. Different perceptual phenomena, such as modal 
and amodal completion, virtual contours, grouping and shape de- 
composition are then explained through local diffusion. The system 
eliminates combinatorial optimization and accounts for many psy- 
chophysical results with a fixed set of parameters.
