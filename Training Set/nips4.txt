Quantitative data on the speed with which animals acquire behav- 
ioral responses during classical conditioning experiments should 
provide strong constraints on models of learning. However, most 
models have simply ignored these data; the few that have attempt- 
ed to address them have failed by at least an order of magnitude. 
We discuss key data on the speed of acquisition, and show how to 
account for them using a statistically sound model of learning, in 
which differential reliabilities of stimuli play a crucial role.
