"Online multi-task learning for semantic concept detection in video." ICIP. 2016.
In this paper we propose an online multi-task learning algorithm for video concept detection. In particular, we extend the Efficient Lifelong Learning Algorithm (ELLA) in the following ways: (a) we solve the objective function of ELLA using quadratic programming instead of solving the Lasso problem, (b) we add a new label-based constraint that considers concept correlations, (c) we use linear SVMs as base learners instead of logistic regression. Experimental results show improvement over both the single-task learning methods typically used in this problem and the original ELLA algorithm.
