 "Santa: Faster Packet Delivery for Commonly Wished Replies." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015.
Increasing network speeds challenge the packet processing performance of networked systems. This can mainly be attributed to processing overhead caused by the split between the kernel-space network stack and user-space applications. To mitigate this overhead, we propose Santa, an application agnostic kernel-level cache of frequent requests. By allowing user-space applications to o?oad frequent requests to the kernel-space, Santa o?ers drastic performance improvements and unlocks the speed of kernel-space networking for legacy server software without requiring extensive changes.
