"Phase Diagram and Storage Capacity of Sequence Storing Neural Networks," Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We solve the dynamics of Hopfield-type neural networks which store se- 
quences of patterns, close to saturation. The asymmetry of the interaction 
matrix in such models leads to violation of detailed balance, ruling out an 
equilibrium statistical mechanical analysis. Using generating functional 
methods we derive exact closed equations for dynamical order parame- 
ters, viz. the sequence overlap and correlation and response functions, 
in the limit of an infinite system size. We calculate the time translation 
invariant solutions of these equations, describing stationary limit-cycles, 
which leads to a phase diagram. The effective retarded self-interaction 
usually appearing in symmetric models is here found to vanish, which 
causes a significantly enlarged storage capacity of acm 0.269, com- 
pared to acm 0.139 for Hopfield networks s[oring static patterns. Our 
results are tested against extensive computer simulations and excellent 
agreement is found.
