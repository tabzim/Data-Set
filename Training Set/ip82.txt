We focus on feature extraction and selection to best represent texture and shape properties of plant diseases in an image-based leaf monitoring system implemented in a mobile-cloud environment. A number of textural and region-based features are aggregated from previous studies; also we introduce mean and peak indices of histogram-of-shape as disease property representations along with the proposed and enhanced shape features based on diseased regions. A total of 260 colour-based attributes and 163 shape attributes are searched to find the best potential features based on different aspects: probability of feature error, correlation, targeted-class relevancy and the separability quality of a feature. Experimental results show that the best selected feature set which combines colour-based and shape features yields high classification accuracy on wheat disease images captured by a smartphone camera and also provides insights into potential sets of features to be further implemented as a lightweight standalone mobile application.
