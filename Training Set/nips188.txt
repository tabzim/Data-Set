"Stationarity and Stability of Autoregressive Neural Network Processes." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We analyze the asymptotic behavior of autoregressive neural net- 
work (AR-NN) processes using techniques from Markov chains and 
non-linear time series analysis. It is shown that standard AR-NNs 
without shortcut connections are asymptotically stationary. If lin- 
ear shortcut connections are allowed, only the shortcut weights 
determine whether the overall system is stationary, hence standard 
conditions for linear AR processes can be used.
