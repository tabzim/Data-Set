"Invariant Feature Extraction and Classification in Kernel Spaces." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We incorporate prior knowledge to construct nonlinear algorithms 
for invariant feature extraction and discrimination. Employing a 
unified framework in terms of a nonlinear variant of the Rayleigh 
coefficient, we propose non-linear generalizations of Fisher's dis- 
criminant and oriented PCA using Support Vector kernel functions. 
Extensive simulations show the utility of our approach.
