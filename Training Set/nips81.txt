"Nonlinear Discriminant Analysis using Kernel Functions." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Fishers linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical multivari- 
ate technique both for dimension reduction and classification. The 
data vectors are transformed into a low dimensional subspace such 
that the class centroids are spread out as much as possible. In 
this subspace LDA works as a simple prototype classifier with lin- 
ear decision boundaries. However, in many applications the linear 
boundaries do not adequately separate the classes. We present a 
nonlinear generalization of discriminant analysis that uses the ker- 
nel trick of representing dot products by kernel functions. The pre- 
sented algorithm allows a simple formulation of the EM-algorithm 
in terms of kernel functions which leads to a unique concept for un- 
supervised mixture analysis, supervised discriminant analysis and 
semi-supervised discriminant analysis with partially unlabelled ob- 
servations in feature spaces.
