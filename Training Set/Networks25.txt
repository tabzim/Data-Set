"Cooperative group provisioning with latency guarantees in multi-cloud deployments." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 45.3 (2015): 4-11.
Given a set of datacenters and groups of application clients, well-connected datacenters can be rented as traffic proxies to reduce client latency. Rental costs must be minimized while meeting the application specific latency needs. Here, we formally define the Cooperative Group Provisioning problem and show it is NP-hard to approximate within a constant factor. We introduce a novel greedy approach and demonstrate its promise through extensive simulation using real cloud network topology measurements and realistic client churn. We ?nd that multi-cloud deployments dramatically increase the likelihood of meeting group latency thresholds with minimal cost increase compared to single-cloud deployments.
