"Population Decoding Based on an Unfaithful Model." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We study a population decoding paradigm in which the maximum likeli- 
hood inference is based on an unfaithful decoding model (UMLI). This 
is usually the case for neural population decoding because the encoding 
process of the brain is not exactly known, or because a simplified de- 
coding model is preferred for saving computational cost. We consider 
an unfaithful decoding model which neglects the pair-wise correlation 
between neuronal activities, and prove that UMLI is asymptotically effi- 
cient when the neuronal correlation is uniform or of limited-range. The 
performance of UMLI is compared with that of the maximum likelihood 
inference based on a faithful model and that of the center of mass de- 
coding method. It turns out that UMLI has advantages of decreasing 
the computational complexity remarkablely and maintaining a high-level 
decoding accuracy at the same time. The effect of correlation on the 
decoding accuracy is also discussed.
