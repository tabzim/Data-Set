"Bayesian modeling of human concept learning" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
I consider the problem of learning concepts from small numbers of pos- 
itive examples, a feat which humans perform routinely but which com- 
puters are rarely capable of. Bridging machine learning and cognitive 
science perspectives, I present both theoretical analysis and an empirical 
study with human subjects for the simple task of learning concepts corre- 
sponding to axis-aligned rectangles in a multidimensional feature space. 
Existing learning models, when applied to this task, cannot explain how 
subjects generalize from only a few examples of the concept. I propose 
a principled Bayesian model based on the assumption that the examples 
are a random sample from the concept to be learned. The model gives 
precise fits to human behavior on this simple task and provides qualitative 
insights into more complex, realistic cases of concept learning.
