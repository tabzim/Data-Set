"Mechanisms of generalization in perceptual learning." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.
The learning of many visual perceptual tasks has been shown to be 
specific to practiced stimuli, while new stimuli require re-learning 
from scratch. Here we demonstrate generalization using a novel 
paradigm in motion discrimination where learning has been previ- 
ously shown to be specific. We trained subjects to discriminate 
the directions of moving dots, and verified the previous results 
that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a new 
one. However, by tracking the subjects' performance across time 
in the new direction, we found that their rate of learning doubled. 
Therefore, learning generalized in a task previously considered too 
difficult for generalization. We also replicated, in the second ex- 
periment, transfer following training with "easy" stimuli. 
The specificity of perceptual learning and the dichotomy between 
learning of "easy" vs. "difficult" tasks were hypothesized to involve 
different learning processes, operating at different visual cortical 
areas. Here we show how to interpret these results in terms of signal 
detection theory. With the assumption of limited computational 
resources, we obtain the observed phenomena -- direct transfer 
and change of learning rate -- for increasing levels of task'difficulty. 
It appears that human generalization concurs with the expected 
behavior of a generic discrimination system.
