"Reconstruction of Sequential Data with Probabilistic Models and Continuity Constraints." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We consider the problem of reconstructing a temporal discrete sequence 
of multidimensional real vectors when part of the data is missing, under 
the assumption that the sequence was generated by a continuous pro- 
cess. A particular case of this problem is multivariate regression, which 
is very difficult when the underlying mapping is one-to-many. We pro- 
pose an algorithm based on a joint probability model of the variables 
of interest, implemented using a nonlinear latent variable model. Each 
point in the sequence is potentially reconstructed as any of the modes 
of the conditional distribution of the missing variables given the present 
variables (computed using an exhaustive mode search in a Gaussian mix- 
ture). Mode selection is determined by a dynamic programming search 
that minimises a geometric measure of the reconstructed sequence, de- 
rived from continuity constraints. We illustrate the algorithm with a toy 
example and apply it to a real-world inverse problem, the acoustic-to- 
articulatory mapping. The results show that the algorithm outperforms 
conditional mean imputation and multilayer perceptrons.
