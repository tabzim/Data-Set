"Learning from Dyadic Data." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
Dyadzc data refers to a domain with two finite sets of objects in 
which observations are made for dyads, i.e., pairs with one element 
from either set. This type of data arises naturally in many ap- 
plication ranging from computational linguistics and information 
retrieval to preference analysis and computer vision. In this paper, 
we present a systematic, domain-independent framework of learn- 
ing from dyadic data by statistical mixture models. Our approach 
covers different models with fiat and hierarchical latent class struc- 
tures. We propose an annealed version of the standard EM algo- 
rithm for model fitting which is empirically evaluated on a variety 
of data sets from different domains.
