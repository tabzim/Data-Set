"General-purpose localization image regions of textured." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We suggest a working definition of texture: Texture is stuff that is 
more compactly represented by its statistics than by specifying the 
configuration of its parts. This definition suggests that to find 
texture we look for outliers to the local statistics, and label as 
texture the regions with no outliers. We present a method, based 
upon this idea, for labeling points in natural scenes as belonging to 
texture regions, while simultaneously allowing us to label low- 
level, bottom-up cues for visual attention. This method is based 
upon recent psychophysics results on processing of texture and 
popout.
