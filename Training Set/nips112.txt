"Online Independent Component Analysis With Local Learning Rate Adaptation." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Stochastic meta-descent (SMD) is a new technique for online adap- 
tation of local learning rates in arbitrary twice-differentiable sys- 
tems. Like matrix momentum it uses full second-order information 
while retaining O(n) computational complexity by exploiting the 
efficient computation of Hessian-vector products. Here we apply 
SMD to independent component analysis, and employ the result- 
ing algorithm for the blind separation of time-varying mixtures. 
By matching individual learning rates to the rate of change in each 
source signal's mixture coefficients, our technique is capable of si- 
multaneously tracking sources that move at very different, a priori 
unknown speeds.
