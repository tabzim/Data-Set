"Analysis of Game Bot's Behavioral Characteristics in Social Interaction Networks of MMORPG." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015.
MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) is one of the best platforms to observe human's behaviors. In collaboration with a leading online game company, NCSoft, we can observe all behaviors in a large-scale of commercialized MMORPG. Especially, we analyzed the behavioral differences between game bots and human users. We categorized the five groups, Bot-Bot, Bot-All, Human-Human, Human-All and All-All, and we observe the characteristics of six social interaction networks for each group. As a result, we found that there are significant differences in social behaviors between game bots and human.
