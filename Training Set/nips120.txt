"Hierarchical Image Probability (HIP) Models." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
We formulate a model for probability distributions on image spaces. We 
show that any distribution of images can be factored exactly into condi- 
tional distributions of feature vectors at one resolution (pyramid level) 
conditioned on the image information at lower resolutions. We would 
like to factor this over positions in the pyramid levels to make it tractable, 
but such factoring may miss long-range dependencies. To fix this, we in- 
troduce hidden class labels at each pixel in the pyramid. The result is 
a hierarchical mixture of conditional probabilities, similar to a hidden 
Markov model on a tree. The model parameters can be found with max- 
imum likelihood estimation using the EM algorithm. We have obtained 
encouraging preliminary results on the problems of detecting various ob- 
jects in SAR images and target recognition in optical aerial images.
