"Channel Noise in Excitable Neuronal Membranes." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
Stochastic fluctuations of voltage-gated ion channels generate current 
and voltage noise in neuronal membranes. This noise may be a criti- 
cal determinant of the efficacy of information processing within neural 
systems. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we carry out a systematic in- 
vestigation of the relationship between channel kinetics and the result- 
ing membrane voltage noise using a stochastic Markov version of the 
Mainen-Sejnowski model of dendritic excitability in cortical neurons. 
Our simulations show that kinetic parameters which lead to an increase 
in membrane excitability (increasing channel densities, decreasing tem- 
perature) also lead to an increase in the magnitude of the sub-threshold 
voltage noise. Noise also increases as the membrane is depolarized from 
rest towards threshold. This suggests that channel fluctuations may in- 
terfere with a neuron's ability to function as an integrator of its synaptic 
inputs and may limit the reliability and precision of neural information 
processing.
