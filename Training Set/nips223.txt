"Learning a Continuous Hidden Variable Model for Binary Data."Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
A directed generative model for binary data using a small number 
of hidden continuous units is investigated. A clipping nonlinear- 
ity distinguishes the model from conventional principal components 
analysis. The relationships between the correlations of the underly- 
ing continuous Gaussian variables and the binary output variables 
are utilized to learn the appropriate weights of the network. The 
advantages of this approach are illustrated on a translationally in- 
variant binary distribution and on handwritten digit images.
