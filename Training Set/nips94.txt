"Support Vector Method for Multivariate Density Estimation." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
A new method for multivariate density estimation is developed 
based on the Support Vector Method (SVM) solution of inverse 
ill-posed problems. The solution has the form of a mixture of den- 
sities. This method with Gaussian kernels compared favorably to 
both Parzen's method and the Gaussian Mixture Model method. 
For synthetic data we achieve more accurate estimates for densities 
of 2, 6, 12, and 40 dimensions.
