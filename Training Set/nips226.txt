"Kernel PCA and De-Noising in Feature Spaces." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
Kernel PCA as a nonlinear feature extractor has proven powerful as a 
preprocessing step for classification algorithms. But it can also be con- 
sidered as a natural generalization of linear principal component anal- 
ysis. This gives rise to the question how to use nonlinear features for 
data compression, reconstruction, and de-noising, applications common 
in linear PCA. This is a nontrivial task, as the results provided by ker- 
nel PCA live in some high dimensional feature space and need not have 
pre-images in input space. This work presents ideas for finding approxi- 
mate pre-images, focusing on Gaussian kernels, and shows experimental 
results using these pre-images in data reconstruction and de-noising on 
toy examples as well as on real world data.
