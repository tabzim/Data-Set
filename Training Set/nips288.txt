"Optimizing admission control while ensuring quality of service in multimedia networks via reinforcement learning." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
This paper examines the application of reinforcement learning to a 
telecommunications networking problem. The problem requires that rev- 
enue be maximized while simultaneously meeting a quality of service 
constraint that forbids entry into certain states. We present a general 
solution to this multi-criteria problem that is able to earn significantly 
higher revenues than alternatives.
