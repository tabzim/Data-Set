 "Correlation filter tracking via bootstrap learning." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
In recent years, correlation filter based trackers outperform better than other trackers. Nevertheless, they only employ one feature and a single kernel, so they are usually not robust in complex scenes. In this paper, we derive a multi-feature and multi-kernel correlation filter based tracker which fully takes advantage of the invariance-discriminative power spectrums of various features and kernels to further improve the performance. A novel bootstrap learning method is utilized to obtain a strong classifier by fusing these weak kernel correlation filters (KCFs). Moreover, a new target scale estimation strategy is incorporated into our framework. The efficient and effective scale estimation method is based on target dictionary representation. The proposed method is tested on several videos and compared with seven state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results have provided further support to the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
