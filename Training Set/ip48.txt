"ICIP 2016 competition on mobile ocular biometric recognition." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
With the unprecedented mobile technology revolution, a number of ocular biometric based personal recognition schemes have been proposed for mobile use cases. The aim of this competition is to evaluate and compare the performance of mobile ocular biometric recognition schemes in visible light on a large scale database (VISOB Dataset ICIP2016 Challenge Version) using standard evaluation methods. Four different teams from universities across the world participated in this competition, submitting five algorithms altogether. The submitted algorithms applied different texture analysis in a learning or a non-learning based framework for ocular recognition. The best results were obtained by a team from Norwegian Biometrics Laboratory (NTNU, Norway), achieving an Equal Error Rate of 0.06% over a quarantined test set.
