"Batch and On-line Parameter Estimation of Gaussian Mixtures Based on the Joint Entropy." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We describe a new iterative method for parameter estimation of Gaus- 
sian mixtures. The new method is based on a framework developed by 
Kivinen and Warmuth for supervised on-line learning. In contrast to gra- 
dient descent and EM, which estimate the mixture's covariance matrices, 
the proposed method estimates the inverses of the covariance matrices. 
Furthermore, the new parameter estimation procedure can be applied in 
both on-line and batch settings. We show experimentally that it is typi- 
cally faster than EM, and usually requires about half as many iterations 
as EM.
