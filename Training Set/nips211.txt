The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative pro- 
cedure for maximum likelihood parameter estimation from data 
sets with missing or hidden variables [2]. It has been applied to 
system identification in linear stochastic state-space models, where 
the state variables are hidden from the observer and both the state 
and the parameters of the model have to be estimated simulta- 
neously [9]. We present a generalization of the EM algorithm for 
parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamical systems. The "expec- 
tation" step makes use of Extended Kalman Smoothing to estimate 
the state, while the "maximization" step re-estimates the parame- 
ters using these uncertain state estimates. In general, the nonlinear 
maximization step is dicult because it requires integrating out the 
uncertainty in the states. However, if Gaussian radial basis func- 
tion (RBF) approximators are used to model the nonlinearities, 
the integrals become tractable and the maximization step can be 
solved via systems of linear equations.
