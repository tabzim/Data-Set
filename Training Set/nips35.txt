"A Geometric Interpretation of v-SVM Classifiers." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We show that the recently proposed variant of the Support Vector 
machine (SVM) algorithm, known as y-SVM, can be interpreted 
as a maximal separation between subsets of the convex hulls of the 
data, which we call soft convex hulls. The soft convex hulls are 
controlled by choice of the parameter y. If the intersection of the 
convex hulls is empty, the hyperplane is positioned halfway between 
them such that the distance between convex hulls, measured along 
the normal, is maximized; and if it is not, the hyperplane's normal 
is similarly determined by the soft convex hulls, but its position 
(perpendicular distance from the origin) is adjusted to minimize 
the error sum. The proposed geometric interpretation of y-SVM 
also leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of 
a choice of y for which the y-SVM solution is nontrivial.
