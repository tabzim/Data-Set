"Dynamics of Supervised Learning with Restricted Training Sets." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
We study the dynamics of supervised learning in layered neural net- 
works, in the regime where the size p of the training set is proportional 
to the number N of inputs. Here the local fields are no longer described 
by Gaussian distributions. We use dynamical replica theory to predict 
the evolution of macroscopic observables, including the relevant error 
measures, incorporating the old formalism in the limit pin  oz.
