Effective methods of capacity control via uniform convergence bounds 
for function expansions have been largely limited to Support Vector ma- 
chines, where good bounds are obtainable by the entropy number ap- 
proach. We extend these methods to systems with expansions in terms of 
arbitrary (parametrized) basis functions and a wide range of regulariza- 
tion methods covering the whole range of general linear additive models. 
This is achieved by a data dependent analysis of the eigenvalues of the 
corresponding design matrix.
