"Asymmetric distance for spherical hashing." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
Usually, most of hashing methods for information retrieval have a two-step procedure, embedding the data into a low-dimensional intermediate space and then quantizing them into binary codes. In the hyperplane-based hashing methods, the distance between the data in the intermediate space can replace the Hamming distance to improve the retrieval accuracy. In this paper, a novel asymmetric distance for the hypersphere-based method is proposed to improve the accuracy of similarity search. By showing that the distance in the intermediate space can approximate the Euclidean distance between the data points, more useful information can be taken to improve the retrieval accuracy. According to the characteristics of the hypersphere-based hashing method, various asymmetric distance models are developed and described. Our experiments with two datasets have demonstrated that the proposed method can improve the retrieval accuracy of the hypersphere-based hashing methods significantly and achieve the state-of-the-art recall performance.
