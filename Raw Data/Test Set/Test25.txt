Characteristics and classification of outlier detection techniques for wireless sensor networks in harsh environments: a survey Artif. Intell. Rev. 43(2): 193-228 (2015)
Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission and reception with joint transmission (JT) allows some neighbouring base stations (BSs) to transmit a user equipment (UE) in the cell edge region its downlink traffic simultaneously such that it can improve the cell edge throughput while mitigating inter-cell interference (ICI). This letter investigates the outage probability of CoMP-JT based on Alamouti...
