"A Theory of Mean Field Approximation." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
I present a theory of mean field approximation based on information ge- 
ometry. This theory includes in a consistent way the naive mean field 
approximation, as well as the TAP approach and the linear response the- 
orem in statistical physics, giving clear information-theoretic interpreta- 
tions to them.
