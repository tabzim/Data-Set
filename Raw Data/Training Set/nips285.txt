"Robust, Efficient, Globally-Optimized Reinforcement Learning with the Parti-Game Algorithm." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
Patti-game (Moore 1994a; Moore 1994b; Moore and Atkeson 1995) is a 
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that has a lot of promise in over- 
coming the curse of dimensionality that can plague RL algorithms when 
applied to high-dimensional problems. In this paper we introduce mod- 
ifications to the algorithm that further improve its performance and ro- 
bustness. In addition, while patti-game solutions can be improved locally 
by standard local path-improvement techniques, we introduce an add-on 
algorithm in the same spirit as parti-game that instead tries to improve 
solutions in a non-local manner.
