"Enabling performance evaluation beyond 10 Gbps." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015
Despite network monitoring and testing being critical for computer networks, current solutions are both extremely expensive and inflexible. This demo presents OSNT (www.osnt.org), a communitydriven, high-performance, open-source traffic generator and capture system built on top of the NetFPGA-10G board which enables flexible network testing. The platform supports full line-rate traffic generation regardless of packet size across the four card ports, packet capture filtering and packet thinning in hardware and sub-usec time precision in traffic generation and capture, corrected using an external GPS device. Furthermore, it provides a software APIs to test the dataplane performance of multi-10G switches, providing a starting point for a number of different test cases. OSNT flexibility is further demonstrated through the OFLOPS-turbo platform: an integration of OSNT with the OFLOPS OpenFlow switch performance evaluation platform, enabling control and data plane evaluation of 10G switches. This demo showcases the applicability of the OSNT platform to evaluate the performance of legacy and OpenFlowenabled networking devices, and demonstrates it using commercial switches.
