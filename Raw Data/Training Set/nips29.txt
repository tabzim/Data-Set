"Spike-based learning rules and stabilization of persistent neural activity." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We analyze the conditions under which synaptic learning rules based 
on action potential timing can be approximated by learning rules based 
on firing rates. In particular, we consider a form of plasticity in which 
synapses depress when a presynaptic spike is followed by a postsynaptic 
spike, and potentiate with the opposite temporal ordering. Such differen- 
tial anti-Hebbianplasticity can be approximated under certain conditions 
by a learning rule that depends on the time derivative of the postsynaptic 
firing rate. Such a learning rule acts to stabilize persistent neural activity 
patterns in recurrent neural networks.
