"Multiple paired forward-inverse models for human motor learning and control." Advances in neural information processing systems. 1999.
Humans demonstrate a remarkable ability to generate accurate and 
appropriate motor behavior under many different and often uncertain 
emqronmental conditions. This paper describes a new modular ap- 
proach to human motor learning and control, based on multiple pairs of 
inverse (controller) and forward (predictor) models. This architecture 
simultaneously learns the multiple inverse models necessary for control 
as well as how to select the inverse models appropriate for a given envi- 
ronment. Simulations of object manipulation demonstrates the ability 
to learn multiple objects, appropriate generalization to novel objects 
and the inappropriate activation of motor programs based on visual 
cues, followed by on-line correction, seen in the "size-weight illusion".
