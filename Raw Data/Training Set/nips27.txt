"An MEG Study of Response Latency and Variability in the Human Visual System During a VisualsMotor Integration Task." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Human reaction times during sensory-motor tasks vary consider- 
ably. To begin to understand how this variability arises, we exam- 
ined neuronal populational response time variability at early versus 
late visual processing stages. The conventional view is that pre- 
cise temporal information is gradually lost as information is passed 
through a layered network of mean-rate "units." We tested in hu- 
mans whether neuronal populations at different processing stages 
behave like mean-rate "units". A blind source separation algorithm 
was applied to MEG signals from sensory-motor integration tasks. 
Response time latency and variability for multiple visual sources 
were estimated by detecting single-trial stimulus-locked events for 
each source. In two subjects tested on four visual reaction time 
tasks, we reliably identified sources belonging to early and late vi- 
sual processing stages. The standard deviation of response latency 
was smaller for early rather than late processing stages. This sup- 
ports the hypothesis that human populational response time vari- 
ability increases from early to late visual processing stages.
