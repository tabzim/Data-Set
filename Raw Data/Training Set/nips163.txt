"Where does the population vector of motor cortical cells point during reaching movements?." Advances in neural information processing systems. 1999.
Visually-guided arm reaching movements are produced by distributed 
neural networks within parietal and frontal regions of the cerebral cortex. 
Experimental data indicate that (1) single neurons in these regions are 
broadly tuned to parameters of movement; (2) appropriate commands are 
elaborated by populations of neurons; (3) the coordinated action of neu- 
rons can be visualized using a neuronal population vector (NPV). How- 
ever, the NPV provides only a rough estimate of movement parameters 
(direction, velocity) and may even fail to reflect the parameters of move- 
ment when arm posture is changed. We designed a model of the cortical 
motor command to investigate the relation between the desired direction 
of the movement, the actual direction of movement and the direction of 
the NPV in motor cortex. The model is a two-layer self-organizing neural 
network which combines broadly-tuned (muscular) proprioceptive and 
(cartesian) visual information to calculate (angular) motor commands for 
the initial part of the movement of a two-link arm. The network was 
trained by motor babbling in 5 positions. Simulations showed that (1) 
the network produced appropriate movement direction over a large part 
of the workspace; (2) small deviations of the actual trajectory from the 
desired trajectory existed at the extremities of the workspace; (3) these 
deviations were accompanied by large deviations of the NPV from both 
trajectories. These results suggest the NPV does not give a faithful image 
of cortical processing during arm reaching movements.
