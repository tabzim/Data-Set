We introduce a novel distributional clustering algorithm that max- 
imizes the mutual information per cluster between data and giv- 
en categories. This algorithm can be considered as a bottom up 
hard version of the recently introduced "Information Bottleneck 
Method". The algorithm is compared with the top-down soft ver- 
sion of the information bottleneck method and a relationship be- 
tween the hard and soft results is established. We demonstrate the 
algorithm on the œ0 Newsgroups data set. For a subset of two news- 
groups we achieve compression by 3 orders of magnitudes loosing 
only 10% of the original mutual information.
