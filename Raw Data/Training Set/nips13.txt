"Recurrent cortical competition: Strengthen or weaken?" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
We investigate the short term dynamics of the recurrent competition and 
neural activity in the primary visual cortex in terms of information pro- 
cessing and in the context of orientation selectivity. We propose that af- 
ter stimulus onset, the strength of the recurrent excitation decreases due 
to fast synaptic depression. As a consequence, the network shifts from 
an initially highly nonlinear to a more linear operating regime. Sharp 
orientation tuning is established in the first highly competitive phase. In 
the second and less competitive phase, precise signaling of multiple ori- 
entations and long range modulation, e.g., by intra- and inter-areal con- 
nections becomes possible (surround effects). Thus the network first ex- 
tracts the salient features from the stimulus, and then starts to process 
the details. We show that this signal processing strategy is optimal if 
the neurons have limited bandwidth and their objective is to transmit the 
maximum amount of information in any time interval beginning with the 
stimulus onset.
