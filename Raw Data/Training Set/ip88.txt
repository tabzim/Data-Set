 "Coral classification with hybrid feature representations." 2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP). IEEE, 2016.
Coral reefs exhibit significant within-class variations, complex between-class boundaries and inconsistent image clarity. This makes coral classification a challenging task. In this paper, we report the application of generic CNN representations combined with hand-crafted features for coral reef classification to take advantage of the complementary strengths of these representation types. We extract CNN based features from patches centred at labelled pixels at multiple scales. We use texture and color based hand-crafted features extracted from the same patches to complement the CNN features. Our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy that is higher than the state-of-art methods on the MLC benchmark dataset for corals.
