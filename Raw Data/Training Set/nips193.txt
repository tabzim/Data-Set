"General Bounds on Bayes Errors for Regression with Gaussian Processes." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
Based on a simple convexity lemma, we develop bounds for differ- 
ent types of Bayesian prediction errors for regression with Gaussian 
processes. The basic bounds are formulated for a fixed training set. 
Simpler expressions are obtained for sampling from an input distri- 
bution which equals the weight function of the covariance kernel, 
yielding asymptotically tight results. The results are compared 
with numerical experiments.
