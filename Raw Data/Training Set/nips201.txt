"Learning a Hierarchical Belief Network of Independent Factor Analyzers." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
Many belief networks have been proposed that are composed of 
binary units. However, for tasks such as object and speech recog- 
nition which produce real-valued data, binary network models are 
usually inadequate. Independent component analysis (ICA) learns 
a model from real data, but the descriptive power of this model 
is severly limited. We begin by describing the independent factor 
analysis (IFA) technique, which overcomes some of the limitations 
of ICA. We then create a multilayer network by cascading single- 
layer IFA models. At each level, the IFA network extracts real- 
valued latent variables that are non-linear functions of the input 
data with a highly adaptive functional form, resulting in a hier- 
archical distributed representation of these data. Whereas exact 
maximum-likelihood learning of the network is intractable, we de- 
rive an algorithm that maximizes a lower bound on the likelihood, 
based on a variational approach.
