"Manifold Stochastic Dynamics for Bayesian Learning." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We propose a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm which is a gen- 
eralization of the stochastic dynamics method. The algorithm performs 
exploration of the state space using its intrinsic geometric structure, facil- 
itating efficient sampling of complex distributions. Applied to Bayesian 
learning in neural networks, our algorithm was found to perform at least 
as well as the best state-of-the-art method while consuming considerably 
less time.
