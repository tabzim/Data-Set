We examine a psychophysical law that describes the influence of 
stimulus and context on perception. According to this law choice 
probability ratios factorize into components independently con- 
trolled by stimulus and context. It has been argued that this pat- 
tern of results is incompatible with feedback models of perception. 
In this paper we examine this claim using neural network models 
defined via stochastic differential equations. We show that the law 
is related to a condition named channel separability and has little 
to do with the existence of feedback connections. In essence, chan- 
nels are separable if they converge into the response units without 
direct lateral connections to other channels and if their sensors are 
not directly contaminated by external inputs to the other chan- 
nels. Implications of the analysis for cognitive and computational 
neurosicence are discussed.
