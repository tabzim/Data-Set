"Synergy and redundancy among brain cells of behaving monkeys." Advances in neural information processing systems. 1999.
Determining the relationship between the activity of a single nerve 
cell to that of an entire population is a fundamental question that 
bears on the basic neural computation paradigms. In this paper 
we apply an information theoretic approach to quantify the level 
of cooperative activity among cells in a behavioral context. It is 
possible to discriminate between synergetic activity of the cells vs. 
redundant activity, depending on the difference between the infor- 
mation they provide when measured jointly and the information 
they provide independently. We define a synergy value that is pos- 
itive in the first case and negative in the second and show that the 
synergy value can be measured by detecting the behavioral mode of 
the animal from simultaneously recorded activity of the cells. We 
observe that among cortical cells positive synergy can be found, 
while cells from the basal ganglia, active during the same task, do 
not exhibit similar synergetic activity.
