In order to to compare learning algorithms, experimental results reported 
in the machine learning litterature often use statistical tests of signifi- 
cance. Unfortunately, most of these tests do not take into account the 
variability due to the choice of training set. We perform a theoretical 
investigation of the variance of the cross-validation estimate of the gen- 
eralization error that takes into account the variability due to the choice 
of training sets. This allows us to propose two new ways to estimate 
this variance. We show, via simulations, that these new statistics perform 
well relative to the statistics considered by Dietterich (Dietterich, 1998).
