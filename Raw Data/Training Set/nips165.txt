"Divisive normalization, line attractor networks and ideal observers." Advances in neural information processing systems. 1999.
Gain control by divisive inhibition, a.k.a. divisive normalization, 
has been proposed to be a general mechanism throughout the vi- 
sual cortex. We explore in this study the statistical properties 
of this normalization in the presence of noise. Using simulations, 
we show that divisive normalization is a close approximation to a 
maximum likelihood estimator, which, in the context of population 
coding, is the same as an ideal observer. We also demonstrate ana- 
lytically that this is a general property of a large class of nonlinear 
recurrent networks with line attractors. Our work suggests that 
divisive normalization plays a critical role in noise filtering, and 
that every cortical layer may be an ideal observer of the activity in 
the preceding layer.
