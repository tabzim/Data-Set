"Neural Networks for Density Estimation." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We introduce two new techniques for density estimation. Our ap- 
proach poses the problem as a supervised learning task which can 
be performed using Neural Networks. We introduce a stochas- 
tic method for learning the cumulative distribution and an analo- 
gous deterministic technique. We demonstrate convergence of our 
methods both theoretically and experimentally, and provide com- 
parisons with the Parzen estimate. Our theoretical results demon- 
strate better convergence properties than the Parzen estimate.
