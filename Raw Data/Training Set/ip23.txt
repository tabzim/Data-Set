"Embedded sparse coding for summarizing multi-view videos." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
Most traditional video summarization methods are designed to generate effective summaries for single-view videos, and thus they cannot fully exploit the complicated intra- and inter-view correlations in summarizing multi-view videos. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for summarizing multi-view videos in a way that takes into consideration both intra- and inter-view correlations in a joint embedding space. We learn the embedding by minimizing an objective function that has two terms: one due to intra-view correlations and another due to inter-view correlations across the multiple views. The solution is obtained by using a Majorization-Minimization algorithm that monotonically decreases the cost function in each iteration. We then employ a sparse representative selection approach over the learned embedding space to summarize the multi-view videos. Experiments on several multi-view datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
