"Familiarity Discrimination of Radar Pulses." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
The ARTMAP-FD neural network performs both identification 
(placing test patterns in classes encountered during training) and 
familiarity discrimination (judging whether a test pattern belongs 
to any of the classes encountered during training). The perfor- 
mance of ARTMAP-FD is tested on radar pulse data obtained in 
the field, and compared to that of the nearest-neighbor-based NEN 
algorithm and to a k ) I extension of NEN.
