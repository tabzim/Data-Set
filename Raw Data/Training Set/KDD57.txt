"Extreme multi-label loss functions for recommendation, tagging, ranking & other missing label applications." Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. ACM, 2016.
The choice of the loss function is critical in extreme multi- label learning where the objective is to annotate each data point with the most relevant subset of labels from an ex- tremely large label set. Unfortunately, existing loss func- tions, such as the Hamming loss, are unsuitable for learning, model selection, hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation. This paper addresses the issue by developing propensity scored losses which: (a) prioritize predicting the few relevant labels over the large number of irrelevant ones; (b) do not erroneously treat missing labels as irrelevant but instead provide unbiased estimates of the true loss func- tion even when ground truth labels go missing under arbi- trary probabilistic label noise models; and (c) promote the accurate prediction of infrequently occurring, hard to pre- dict, but rewarding tail labels. Another contribution is the development of the PfastreXML algorithm (code available from [1]) which efficiently scales to large datasets with up to 9 million labels, 70 million points and 2 million dimensions and which gives significant improvements over the state-of- the-art.
This paper’s results also apply to tagging, recommenda- tion and ranking which are the motivating applications for extreme multi-label learning. They generalize previous at- tempts at deriving unbiased losses under the restrictive as- sumption that labels go missing uniformly at random from the ground truth. Furthermore, they provide a sound the- oretical justification for popular label weighting heuristics used to recommend rare items. Finally, they demonstrate that the proposed contributions align with real world ap- plications by achieving superior clickthrough rates on spon- sored search advertising in Bing.
