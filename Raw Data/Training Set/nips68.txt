"Topographic Transformation as a Discrete Latent Variable." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
Invariance to topographic transformations such as translation and 
shearing in an image has been successfully incorporated into feed- 
forward mechanisms, e.g., "convolutional neural networks", "tan- 
gent propagation". We describe a way to add transformation invari- 
ance to a generafive density model by approximating the nonlinear 
transformation manifold by a discrete set of transformations. An 
EM algorithm for the original model can be extended to the new 
model by computing expectations over the set of transformations. 
We show how to add a discrete transformation variable to Gaussian 
mixture modeling, factor analysis and mixtures of factor analysis. 
We give results on filtering microscopy images, face and facial pose 
clustering, and handwritten digit modeling and recognition.
