"Approximate inference algorithms for two-layer Bayesian networks." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We present a class of approximate inference algorithms for graphical 
models of the QMR-DT type. We give convergence rates for these al- 
gorithms and for the Jaakkola and Jordan (1999) algorithm, and verify 
these theoretical predictions empirically. We also present empirical re- 
sults on the difficult QMR-DT network problem, obtaining performance 
of the new algorithms roughly comparable to the Jaakkola and Jordan 
algorithm.
