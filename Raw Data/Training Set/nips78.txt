"Large Margin DAGs for Multiclass Classification." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We present a new learning architecture: the Decision Directed Acyclic 
Graph (DDAG), which is used to combine many two-class classifiers 
into a multiclass classifier. For an N-class problem, the DDAG con- 
tains N(N - 1)/2 classifiers, one for each pair of classes. We present a 
VC analysis of the case when the node classifiers are hyperplanes; the re- 
sulting bound on the test error depends on N and on the margin achieved 
at the nodes, but not on the dimension of the space. This motivates an 
algorithm, DAGSVM, which operates in a kernel-induced feature space 
and uses two-class maximal margin hyperplanes at each decision-node 
of the DDAG. The DAGSVM is substantially faster to train and evalu- 
ate than either the standard algorithm or Max Wins, while maintaining 
comparable accuracy to both of these algorithms.
