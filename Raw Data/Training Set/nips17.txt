The encoding accuracy of a population of stochastically spiking neurons 
is studied for different distributions of their tuning widths. The situation 
of identical radially symmetric receptive fields for all neurons, which 
is usually considered in the literature, turns out to be disadvantageous 
from an information-theoretic point of view. Both a variability of tun- 
ing widths and a fragmentation of the neural population into specialized 
subpopulations improve the encoding accuracy.
