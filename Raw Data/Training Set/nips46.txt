"Understanding stepwise generalization of Support Vector Machines: a toy model." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
In this article we study the effects of introducing structure in the 
input distribution of the data to be learnt by a simple perceptron. 
We determine the learning curves within the framework of Statis- 
tical Mechanics. Stepwise generalization occurs as a function of 
the number of examples when the distribution of patterns is highly 
anisotropic. Although extremely simple, the model seems to cap- 
ture the relevant features of a class of Support Vector Machines 
which was recently shown to present this behavior.
