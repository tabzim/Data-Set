 "Position dependent prediction combination for intra-frame video coding." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
Intra-frame prediction in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard can be empirically improved by applying sets of recursive two-dimensional filters to the predicted values. However, this approach does not allow (or complicates significantly) the parallel computation of pixel predictions. In this work we analyze why the recursive filters are effective, and use the results to derive sets of non-recursive predictors that have superior performance. We present an extension to HEVC intra prediction that combines values predicted using non-filtered and filtered (smoothed) reference samples, depending on the prediction mode, and block size. Simulations using the HEVC common test conditions show that a 2.0% bit rate average reduction can be achieved compared to HEVC, for All Intra (AI) configurations.
