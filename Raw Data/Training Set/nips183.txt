"Unsupervised and supervised clustering: the mutual information between parameters and observations." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
Recent works in parameter estimation and neural coding have 
demonstrated that optimal performance are related to the mutual 
information between parameters and data. We consider the mutual 
information in the case where the dependency in the parameter (a 
vector 0) of the conditional p.d.f. of each observation (a vector 
), is through the scalar product 0. only. We derive bounds and 
asymptotic behaviour for the mutual information and compare with 
results obtained on the same model with the "replica technique".
