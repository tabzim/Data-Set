"Computation of Smooth Optical Flow in a Feedback Connected Analog Network." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
In 1986, Tanner and Mead [1] implemented an interesting constraint sat- 
isfaction circuit for global motion sensing in aVLSI. We report here a 
new and improved aVLSI implementation that provides smooth optical 
flow as well as global motion in a two dimensional visual field. The com- 
putation of optical flow is an ill-posed problem, which expresses itself as 
the aperture problem. However, the optical flow can be estimated by the 
use of regularization methods, in which additional constraints are intro- 
duced in terms of a global energy functional that must be minimized. We 
show how the algorithmic constraints of Horn and Schunck [2] on com- 
puting smooth optical flow can be mapped onto the physical constraints 
of an equivalent electronic network.
