 "Patch similarity based edge-preserving background estimation for single frame infrared small target detection." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
Edges in infrared image usually cause serious false alarms in single frame infrared small target detection. So a novel edge-preserving background estimation method is proposed for small target detection to attenuate this problem. First we will introduce the patch similarity feature of infrared image. Then, patch similarity of infrared image is utilized to formulate edge-preserving infrared background estimation. At last, estimated background will be eliminated from original infrared image to suppress edges. The effective edge-preserving ability of our approach will be shown through experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art background estimation methods.
