"Graphical Models for Recognizing Human Interactions." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
We describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning sys- 
tem for modeling and recognizing human actions and interactions. 
Two different domains are explored: recognition of two-handed 
motions in the martial art 'Tai Chi', and multiple-person interac- 
tions in a visual surveillance task. Our system combines top-down 
with bottom-up information using a feedback loop, and is formu- 
lated with a Bayesian framework. Two different graphical models 
(HMMs and Coupled HMMs) are used for modeling both individual 
actions and multiple-agent interactions, and CHMMs are shown to 
work more efficiently and accurately for a given amount of train- 
ing. Finally, to overcome the limited amounts of training data, 
we demonstrate that 'synthetic agents' (Alife-style agents) can be 
used to develop flexible prior models of the person-to-person inter- 
actions.
