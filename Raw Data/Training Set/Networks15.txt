 "An evaluation of tail loss recovery mechanisms for TCP." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 45.1 (2015): 5-11.
Interactive applications do not require more bandwidth to go faster. Instead, they require less latency. Unfortunately, the current design of transport protocols such as TCP limits possible latency reductions. In this paper we evaluate and compare di?erent loss recovery enhancements to ?ght tail loss latency. The two recently proposed mechanisms "RTO Restart" (RTOR) and "Tail Loss Probe" (TLP) as well as a new mechanism that applies the logic of RTOR to the TLP timer management (TLPR) are considered. The results show that the relative performance of RTOR and TLP when tail loss occurs is scenario dependent, but with TLP having potentially larger gains. The TLPR mechanism reaps the bene?ts of both approaches and in most scenarios it shows the best performance.
