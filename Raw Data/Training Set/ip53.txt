 "User experience in immersive TV—A research agenda." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
This paper explores existing theories and models for investigating user experience in the context of Distributed Interactive Multimedia Environments (DIME) in the framework of an immersive TV show developed within ACTION-TV project. A descriptive research framework is suggested, which integrates Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE) and User Experience (UX) to support user-centered design and development in DIME. A study, which was conducted during the project and which addresses different aspects of the framework, is presented.
