The support vector machine (SVM) is a state-of-the-art technique 
for regression and classification, combining excellent generalisation 
properties with a sparse kernel representation. However, it does 
suffer from a number of disadvantages, notably the absence of prob- 
abilistic outputs, the requirement to estimate a trade-off parameter 
and the need to utilise 'Mercer' kernel functions. In this paper we 
introduce the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a Bayesian treat- 
ment of a generalised linear model of identical functional form to 
the SVM. The RVM suffers from none of the above disadvantages, 
and examples demonstrate that for comparable generalisation per- 
formance, the RVM requires dramatically fewer kernel functions.
