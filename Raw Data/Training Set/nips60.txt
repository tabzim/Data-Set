"Transductive Inference for Estimating Values of Functions." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We introduce an algorithm for estimating the values of a function 
at a set of test points Xt+l, ß ß ß, Xt+ra given a set of training points 
(Xl, Yl),-.., (xt, Yt) without estimating (as an intermediate step) 
the regression function. We demonstrate that this direct (transduc- 
rive) way for estimating values of the regression (or classification 
in pattern recognition) can be more accurate than the tradition- 
al one based on two steps, first estimating the function and then 
calculating the values of this function at the points of interest.
