"Optimizing Correlation Algorithms for Hardware-based Transient Classification." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
The performance of dedicated VLSI neural processing hardware depends 
critically on the design of the implemented algorithms. We have pre- 
viously proposed an algorithm for acoustic transient classification [1]. 
Having implemented and demonstrated this algorithm in a mixed-mode 
architecture, we now investigate variants on the algorithm, using time 
and frequency channel differencing, input and output normalization, and 
schemes to binarize and train the template values, with the goal of achiev- 
ing optimal classification performance for the chosen hardware.
