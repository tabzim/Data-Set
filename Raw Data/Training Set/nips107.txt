"Bayesian modelling of fMRI time series." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
We present a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for inferring the hidden 
psychological state (or neural activity) during single trial fMRI activa- 
tion experiments with blocked task paradigms. Inference is based on 
Bayesian methodology, using a combination of analytical and a variety 
of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques. The ad- 
vantage of this method is that detection of short time learning effects be- 
tween repeated trials is possible since inference is based only on single 
trial experiments.
