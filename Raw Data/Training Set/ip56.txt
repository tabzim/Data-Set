 "Real-time 3D body reconstruction for immersive TV." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
In this work, a novel and fast algorithm for real-time 3D body reconstruction from stereo sequences is proposed. The main contributions of this work consist of a novel approach for a statistically guided stereo processing and a data parallel iteration scheme for 3D estimation that includes temporal predecessors from a local spatial neighborhood. A purely GPU based implementation is provided that exhibits a nearly linear scaling of the runtime with respect to the number of GPUs. This leads to an inherent sub-pixel processing due to the availability of hardware supported texture lookups. Our implementation is able to process 4K (UHD) stereo streams on a 4×4 grid with 30 fps on a single state-of-the-art consumer graphics card. The algorithmic performance of our approach is demonstrated in the context of an immersive TV application.
