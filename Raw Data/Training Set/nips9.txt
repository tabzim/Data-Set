"Rules and Similarity in Concept Learning." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
This paper argues that two apparently distinct modes of generalizing con- 
cepts - abstracting rules and computing similarity to exemplars - should 
both be seen as special cases of a more general Bayesian learning frame- 
work. Bayes explains the specific workings of these two modes - which 
rules are abstracted, how similarity is measured - as well as why gener- 
alization should appear rule- or similarity-based in different situations. 
This analysis also suggests why the rules/similarity distinction, even if 
not computationally fundamental, may still be useful at the algorithmic 
level as part of a principled approximation to fully Bayesian learning.
