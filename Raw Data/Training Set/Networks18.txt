 "Cluster based multipath routing protocol for wireless sensor networks." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 45.2 (2015): 14-20.
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of low power sensor nodes. Energy is the main constraint associated with the sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a cluster based multipath routing protocol, which uses the clustering and multipath techniques to reduce energy consumption and increase the reliability. The basic idea is to reduce the load of the sensor node by giving more responsibility to the base station (sink). We have implemented and compared the protocol with existing protocols and found that it is more energy-e?cient and reliable.
