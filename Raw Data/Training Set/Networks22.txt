 "Data transparency lab kick off workshop (DTL 2014) report." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 45.2 (2015): 44-48.
On November 20 and 21 2014, Telefonica I+D hosted the Data Transparency Lab ("DTL") Kicko? Workshop on Personal Data Transparency and Online Privacy at its headquarters in Barcelona, Spain. This workshop provided a forum for technologists, researchers, policymakers and industry representatives to share and discuss current and emerging issues around privacy and transparency on the Internet. The objective of this workshop was to kick-start the creation of a community of research, industry, and public interest parties that will work together towards the following objectives: - The development of methodologies and user-friendly tools to promote transparency and empower users to understand online privacy issues and consequences; - The sharing of datasets and research results, and; - The support of research through grants and the provision of infrastructure to deploy tools. With the above activities, the DTL community aims to improve our understanding of technical, ethical, economic and regulatory issues related to the use of personal data by online services. It is hoped that successful execution of such activities will help sustain a fair and transparent exchange of personal data online. This report summarizes the presentations, discussions and questions that resulted from the workshop.
