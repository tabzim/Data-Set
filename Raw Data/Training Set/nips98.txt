"Data Visualization and Feature Selection: New Algorithms for Nongaussian Data." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Data visualization and feature selection methods are proposed 
based on the joint mutual information and ICA. The visualization 
methods can find many good 2-D projections for high dimensional 
data interpretation, which cannot be easily found by the other ex- 
isting methods. The new variable selection method is found to be 
better in eliminating redundancy in the inputs than other methods 
based on simple mutual information. The efficacy of the methods 
is illustrated on a radar signal analysis problem to find 2-D viewing 
coordinates for data visualization and to select inputs for a neural 
network classifier.
