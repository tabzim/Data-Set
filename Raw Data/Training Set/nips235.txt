"SMEM Algorithm for Mixture Models Naonori Ueda Ryohei Nakano." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We present a split and merge EM (SMEM) algorithm to overcome the local 
maximum problem in parameter estimation of finite mixture models. In the 
case of mixture models, non-global maxima often involve having too many 
components of a mixture model in one part of the space and too few in an- 
other, widely separated part of the space. To escape from such configurations 
we repeatedly perform simultaneous split and merge operations using a new 
criterion for efficiently selecting the split and merge candidates. We apply 
the proposed algorithm to the training of Gaussian mixtures and mixtures of 
factor analyzers using synthetic and real data and show the effectiveness of 
using the split and merge operations to improve the likelihood of both the 
training data and of held-out test data.
