"A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm in Partially Observable Environments Using Short-Term Memory." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
We describe a Reinforcement Learning algorithm for partially observ- 
able environments using short-term memory, which we call BLHT. Since 
BLHT learns a stochastic model based on Bayesian Learning, the over- 
fitting problem is reasonably solved. Moreover, BLHT has an efficient 
implementation. This paper shows that the model learned by BLHT con- 
verges to one which provides the most accurate predictions of percepts 
and rewards, given short-term memory.
