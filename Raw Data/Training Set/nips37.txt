"Potential Boosters ?" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Recent interpretations of the Adaboost algorithm view it as per- 
forming a gradient descent on a potential function. Simply chang- 
ing the potential function allows one to create new algorithms re- 
lated to AdaBoost. However, these new algorithms are generally 
not known to have the formal boosting property. This paper ex- 
mines the question of which potential functions lead to new al- 
gorithms that are boosters. The two main results are general sets 
of conditions on the potential; one set implies that the resulting 
algorithm is a booster, while the other implies that the algorithm 
is not. These conditions are applied to previously studied potential 
functions, such as those used by LogitBoost and Doom II.
