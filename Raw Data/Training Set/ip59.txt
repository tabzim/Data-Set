 "Vessel segmentation in low contrast X-ray angiogram images." 2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP). IEEE, 2016.
Coronary artery disease is one of the major causes of death throughout the world. An effective method for diagnosing this disease is X-ray angiography. The images are usually of poor quality and low contrast. This is due to non-uniform illumination, appearance of other body organs and artifacts, low SNR values, etc. Accurate segmentation of arteries is a challenging and important task. In this paper we first extract coronary arteries region of interest (ROI) using Hessian filter. Then, we combine these results with the flux flow measurements for accurate identification of vessel pixels. Post processing is performed to eliminate falsely identified vessel pixels. Finally, we segment the coronary arteries by selecting the largest connected component. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our method show high effectiveness of the proposed method. In terms of capturing major vessels our method is successful in 96% of cases.
