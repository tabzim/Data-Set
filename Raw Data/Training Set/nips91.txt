"On input selection with reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
In this paper we will treat input selection for a radial basis function 
(RBF) like classifier within a Bayesian framework. We approximate 
the a-posteriori distribution over both model coefficients and input 
subsets by samples drawn with Gibbs updates and reversible jump 
moves. Using some public datasets, we compare the classification 
accuracy of the method with a conventional ARD scheme. These 
datasets are also used to infer the a-posteriori probabilities of dif- 
ferent input subsets.
