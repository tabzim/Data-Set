A latent variable generative model with finite noise is used to de- 
scribe several different algorithms for Independent Components Anal- 
ysis (ICA). In particular, the Fixed Point ICA algorithm is shown to 
be equivalent to the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for maximum 
likelihood under certain constraints, allowing the conditions for global 
convergence to be elucidated. The algorithms can also be explained by 
their generic behavior near a singular point where the size of the opti- 
mal generarive bases vanishes. An expansion of the likelihood about this 
singular point indicates the role of higher order correlations in determin- 
ing the features discovered by ICA. The application and convergence of 
these algorithms are demonstrated on a simple illustrative example.
