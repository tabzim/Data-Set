The curse of dimensionality is severe when modeling high-dimensional 
discrete data: the number of possible combinations of the variables ex- 
plodes exponentially. In this paper we propose a new architecture for 
modeling high-dimensional data that requires resources (parameters and 
computations) that grow only at most as the square of the number of vari- 
ables, using a multi-layer neural network to represent the joint distribu- 
tion of the variables as the product of conditional distributions. The neu- 
ral network can be interpreted as a graphical model without hidden ran- 
dom variables, but in which the conditional distributions are tied through 
the hidden units. The connectivity of the neural network can be pruned by 
using dependency tests between the variables. Experiments on modeling 
the distribution of several discrete data sets show statistically significant 
improvements over other methods such as naive Bayes and comparable 
Bayesian networks, and show that significant improvements can be obtained by pruning the network.
