"Model selection in clustering by uniform convergence bounds." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
Unsupervised learning algorithms are designed to extract struc- 
ture from data samples. Reliable and robust inference requires a 
guarantee that extracted structures are typical for the data source, 
i.e., similar structures have to be inferred from a second sample 
set of the same data source. The overfitting phenomenon in max- 
imum entropy based annealing algorithms is exemplarily studied 
for a class of histogram clustering models. Bernstein's inequality 
for large deviations is used to determine the maximally achievable 
approximation quality parameterized by a minimal temperature. 
Monte Carlo simulations support the proposed model selection cri- 
terion by finite temperature annealing.
