 "Alternative trust sources: Reducing DNSSEC signature verification operations with TLS." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015.
DNSSEC has been in development for 20 years. It provides for provable security when retrieving domain names through the use of a public key infrastructure (PKI). Unfortunately, there is also significant overhead involved with DNSSEC: verifying certificate chains of signed DNS messages involves extra computation, queries to remote resolvers, additional transfers, and introduces added latency into the DNS query path. We pose the question: is it possible to achieve practical security without always verifying this certificate chain if we use a different, outside source of trust between resolvers? We believe we can. Namely, by using a long-lived, mutually authenticated TLS connection between pairs of DNS resolvers, we suggest that we can maintain near-equivalent levels of security with very little extra overhead compared to a non-DNSSEC enabled resolver. By using a reputation system or probabilistically verifying a portion of DNSSEC responses would allow for near-equivalent levels of security to be reached, even in the face of compromised resolvers.
