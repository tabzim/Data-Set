The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) (9) is an objective 
method for quantifying facial movement in terms of component 
actions. This system is widely used in behavioral investigations 
of emotion, cognitive processes, and social interaction. The cod- 
ing is presently performed by highly trained human experts. This 
paper explores and compares techniques for automatically recog- 
nizing facial actions in sequences of images. These methods include 
unsupervised learning techniques for finding basis images such as 
principal component analysis, independent component analysis and 
local feature analysis, and supervised learning techniques such as 
Fisher's linear discriminants. These data-driven bases are com- 
pared to Gabor wavelets, in which the basis images are predefined. 
Best performances were obtained using the Gabor wavelet repre- 
sentation and the independent component representation, both of 
which achieved 96% accuracy for classifying 12 facial actions. The 
ICA representation employs 2 orders of magnitude fewer basis im- 
ages than the Gabor representation and takes 90% less CPU time 
to compute for new images. The results provide converging support 
for using local basis images, high spatial frequencies, and statistical 
independence for classifying facial actions.
