"Visualizing Group Structure." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
Cluster analysis is a fundamental principle in exploratory data 
analysis, providing the user with a description of the group struc- 
ture of given data. A key problem in this context is the interpreta- 
tion and visualization of clustering solutions in high-dimensional 
or abstract data spaces. In particular, probabilistic descriptions 
of the group structure, essential to capture inter-cluster relation- 
ships, are hardly assessable by simple inspection of the probabilistic 
assignment variables. We present a novel approach to the visual- 
ization of group structure. It is based on a statistical model of the 
object assignments which have been observed or estimated by a 
probabilistic clustering procedure. The objects or data points are 
embedded in a low dimensional Euclidean space by approximating 
the observed data statistics with a Gaussian mixture model. The 
algorithm provides a new approach to the visualization of the inher- 
ent structure for a broad variety of data types, e.g. histogram data, 
proximity data and co-occurrence data. To demonstrate the power 
of the approach, histograms of textured images are visualized as an 
example of a large-scale data mining application.
