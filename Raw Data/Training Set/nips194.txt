"Mean field methods for classification with Gaussian processes." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We discuss the application of TAP mean field methods known from 
the Statistical Mechanics of disordered systems to Bayesian classifi- 
cation models with Gaussian processes. In contrast to previous ap- 
proaches, no knowledge about the distribution of inputs is needed. 
Simulation results for the Sonar data set are given.
