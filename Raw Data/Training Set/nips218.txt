"Restructuring Sparse High Dimensional Data for Effective Retrieval." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
The task in text retrieval is to find the subset of a collection of documents relevant 
to a user's information request, usually expressed as a set of words. Classically, 
documents and queries are represented as vectors of word counts. In its simplest 
form, relevance is defined to be the dot product between a document and a query 
vector-a measure of the number of common terms. A central difficulty in text 
retrieval is that the presence or absence of a word is not sufficient to determine 
relevance to a query. Linear dimensionality reduction has been proposed as a tech- 
nique for extracting underlying structure from the document collection. In some 
domains (such as vision) dimensionality reduction reduces computational com- 
plexity. In text retrieval it is more often used to improve retrieval performance. 
We propose an alternative and novel technique that produces sparse represen- 
tations constructed from sets of highly-related words. Documents and queries 
are represented by their distance to these sets, and relevance is measured by the 
number of common clusters. This technique significantly improves retrieval per- 
formance, is efficient to compute and shares properties with the optimal linear 
projection operator and the independent components of documents.
