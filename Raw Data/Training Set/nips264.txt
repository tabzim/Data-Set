"Learning Lie Groups for Invariant Visual Perception." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
One of the most important problems in visual perception is that of visual in- 
variance: how are objects perceived to be the same despite undergoing transfor- 
mations such as translations, rotations or scaling? In this paper, we describe a 
Bayesian method for learning invariances based on Lie group theory. We show 
that previous approaches based on first-order Taylor series expansions of inputs 
can be regarded as special cases of the Lie group approach, the latter being ca- 
pable of handling in principle arbitrarily large transformations. Using a matrix- 
exponential based generative model of images, we derive an unsupervised al- 
gorithm for learning Lie group operators from input data containing infinites- 
imal transformations. The on-line unsupervised learning algorithm maximizes 
the posterior probability of generating the training data. We provide experimen- 
tal results suggesting that the proposed method can learn Lie group operators for 
handling reasonably large 1-D translations and 2-D rotations.
