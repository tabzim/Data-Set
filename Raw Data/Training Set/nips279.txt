"Reinforcement Learning for Trading." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We propose to train trading systems by optimizing financial objec- 
tive functions via reinforcement learning. The performance func- 
tions that we consider are profit or wealth, the Sharpe ratio and 
our recently proposed differential Sharpe ratio for online learn- 
ing. In Moody & Wu (1997), we presented empirical results that 
demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning relative to 
supervised learning. Here we extend our previous work to com- 
pare Q-Learning to our Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RRL) 
algorithm. We provide new simulation results that demonstrate 
the presence of predictability in the monthly S&P 500 Stock Index 
for the 25 year period 1970 through 1994, as well as a sensitivity 
analysis that provides economic insight into the trader's structure.
