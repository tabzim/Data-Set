"Support Vector Machines Applied to Face Recognition." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
Face recognition is a K class problem, where K is the number of known 
individuals; and support vector machines (SVMs) are a binary classi- 
fication method. By reformulating the face recognition problem and re- 
interpreting the output of the SVM classifier, we developed a SVM-based 
face recognition algorithm. The face recognition problem is formulated 
as a problem in difference space, which models dissimilarities between 
two facial images. In difference space we formulate face recognition as a 
two class problem. The classes are: dissimilarities between faces of the 
same person, and dissimilarities between faces of different people. By 
modifying the interpretation of the decision surface generated by SVM, 
we generated a similarity metric between faces that is learned from ex- 
amples of differences between faces. The SVM-based algorithm is com- 
pared with a principal component analysis (PCA) based algorithm on a 
difficult set of images from the FERET database. Performance was mea- 
sured for both verification and identification scenarios. The identification 
performance for SVM is 77-78% versus 54% for PCA. For verification, 
the equal error rate is 7% for SVM and 13% for PCA.
