"Spectral Cues in Human Sound Localization." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
The differential contribution of the monaural and interaural spectral 
cues to human sound localization was examined using a combined psy- 
chophysical and analytical approach. The cues to a sound's location 
were correlated on an individual basis with the human localization re- 
sponses to a variety of spectrally manipulated sounds. The spectral cues 
derive from the acoustical filtering of an individual's auditory periphery 
which is characterized by the measured head-related transfer functions 
(HRTFs). Auditory localization performance was determined in virtual 
auditory space (VAS). Psychoacoustical experiments were conducted in 
which the amplitude spectra of the sound stimulus was varied indepen- 
dently at each ear while preserving the normal timing cues, an impossibil- 
ity in the free-field environment. Virtual auditory noise stimuli were gen- 
erated over earphones for a specified target direction such that there was 
a "false" flat spectrum at the left eardrum. Using the subject's HRTFs, 
the sound spectrum at the right eardrum was then adjusted so that either 
the true right monaural spectral cue or the true interaural spectral cue 
was preserved. All subjects showed systematic mislocalizations in both 
the true right and true interaural spectral conditions which was absent in 
their control localization performance. The analysis of the different cues 
along with the subjects' localization responses suggests there are signif- 
icant differences in the use of the monaural and interaural spectral cues 
and that the auditory system's reliance on the spectral cues varies with 
the sound condition.
