Almost Linear VC Dimension Bounds for Piecewise Polynomial Networks 
We compute upper and lower bounds on the VC dimension of 
feedforward networks of units with piecewise polynomial activa- 
tion functions. We show that if the number of layers is fixed, then 
the VC dimension grows as W log W, where W is the number of 
parameters in the network. This result stands in opposition to the 
case where the number of layers is unbounded, in which case the 
VC dimension grows as W 2.
