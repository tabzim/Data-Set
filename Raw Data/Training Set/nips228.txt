"Replicator Equations, Maximal Cliques, and Graph Isomorphis." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We present a new energy-minimization framework for the graph 
isomorphism problem which is based on an equivalent maximum 
clique formulation. The approach is centered around a fundamental 
result proved by Motzkin and Straus in the mid-1960s, and recently 
expanded in various ways, which allows us to formulate the maxi- 
mum clique problem in terms of a standard quadratic program. To 
solve the program we use "replicator" equations, a class of simple 
continuous- and discrete-time dynamical systems developed in var- 
ious branches of theoretical biology. We show how, despite their 
inability to escape from local solutions, they nevertheless provide 
experimental results which are competitive with those obtained us- 
ing more elaborate mean-field annealing heuristics.
