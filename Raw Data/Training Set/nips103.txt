"A Neuromorphic VLSI System for Modeling the Neural Control of Axial Locomotion." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We have developed and tested an analog/digital VLSI system that mod- 
els the coordination of biological segmental oscillators underlying axial 
locomotion in animals such as leeches and lampreys. In its current form 
the system consists of a chain of twelve pattern generating circuits that 
are capable of arbitrary contralateral inhibitory synaptic coupling. Each 
pattern generating circuit is implemented with two independent silicon 
Morris-Lecar neurons with a total of 32 programmable (floating-gate 
based) inhibitory synapses, and an asynchronous address-event inter- 
connection element that provides synaptic connectivity and implements 
axonal delay. We describe and analyze the data from a set of experi- 
ments exploring the system behavior in terms of synaptic coupling.
