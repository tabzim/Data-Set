 "Latent space model for road networks to predict time-varying traffic." Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. ACM, 2016.
Real-time traf?c prediction from high-?delity spatiotemporal traf?c sensor datasets is an important problem for intelligent transportation systems and sustainability. However, it is challenging due to the complex topological dependencies and high dynamism associated with changing road conditions. In this paper, we pro-pose a Latent Space Model for Road Networks (LSM-RN) to ad-dress these challenges holistically. In particular, given a series of road network snapshots, we learn the attributes of vertices in latent spaces which capture both topological and temporal properties. As these latent attributes are time-dependent, they can estimate how traf?c patterns form and evolve. In addition, we present an incremental online algorithm which sequentially and adaptively learns the latent attributes from the temporal graph changes. Our frame-work enables real-time traf?c prediction by 1) exploiting real-time sensor readings to adjust/update the existing latent spaces, and 2) training as data arrives and making predictions on-the-?y. By con-ducting extensive experiments with a large volume of real-world traf?c sensor data, we demonstrate the superiority of our frame-work for real-time traf?c prediction on large road networks over competitors as well as baseline graph-based LSM’s.
