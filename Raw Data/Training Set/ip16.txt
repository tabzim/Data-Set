"PRNU based source attribution with a collection of seam-carved images." Image Processing (ICIP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.
Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) noise based source attribution is a well known technique to verify the source camera of an anonymous image or video. Researchers have proposed various counter measures to PRNU based source camera attribution. Forced seam-carving is a recently proposed counter forensics measure that was proposed to defeat PRNU based source attribution by disturbing the alignment of PRNU noise patterns. This paper shows that given a multiple number of seam-carved images, source attribution can still be reliably made even if the size of a non-carved image block is less than the recommended size of 50×50.
