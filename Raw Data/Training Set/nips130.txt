"Constructing Heterogeneous Committees Using Input Feature Grouping: Application to Economic Forecasting." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
The committee approach has been proposed for reducing model 
uncertainty and improving generalization performance. The ad- 
vantage of committees depends on (1) the performance of individ- 
ual members and (2) the correlational structure of errors between 
members. This paper presents an input grouping technique for de- 
signing a heterogeneous committee. With this technique, all input 
variables are first grouped based on their mutual information. Sta- 
tistically similar variables are assigned to the same group. Each 
member's input set is then formed by input variables extracted 
from different groups. Our designed committees have less error cor- 
relation between its members, since each member observes different 
input variable combinations. The individual member's feature sets 
contain less redundant information, because highly correlated vari- 
ables will not be combined together. The member feature sets con- 
tain almost complete information, since each set contains a feature 
from each information group. An empirical study for a noisy and 
nonstationary economic forecasting problem shows that commit- 
tees constructed by our proposed technique outperform committees 
formed using several existing techniques.
