New functionals for parameter (model) selection of Support Vector Ma- 
chines are introduced based on the concepts of the span of support vec- 
tors and rescaling of the feature space. It is shown that using these func- 
tionals, one can both predict the best choice of parameters of the model 
and the relative quality of performance for any value of parameter.
