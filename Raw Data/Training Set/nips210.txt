"A Randomized Algorithm for Pairwise Clustering." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We present a stochastic clustering algorithm based on pairwise sim- 
ilarity of datapoints. Our method extends existing deterministic 
methods, including agglomerative algorithms, min-cut graph algo- 
rithms, and connected components. Thus it provides a common 
framework for all these methods. Our graph-based method differs 
from existing stochastic methods which are based on analogy to 
physical systems. The stochastic nature of our method makes it 
more robust against noise, including accidental edges and small 
spurious clusters. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm 
using an example with 3 spiraling bands and a lot of noise.
