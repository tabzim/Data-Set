"Churn Reduction in the Wireless Industry." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Competition in the wireless telecommunications industry is rampant. To main- 
tain profitability, wireless carriers must control churn, the loss of subscribers 
who switch from one carder to another. We explore statistical techniques for 
chum prediction and, based on these predictions, an optimal policy for identify- 
ing customers to whom incentives should be offered to increase retention. Our 
experiments are based on a data base of nearly 47,000 U.S. domestic subscrib- 
ers, and includes information about their usage, billing, credit, application, and 
complaint history. We show that under a wide variety of assumptions concerning 
the cost of intervention and the retention rate resulting from intervention, chum 
prediction and remediation can yield significant savings to a carrier. We also 
show the importance of a data representation crafted by domain experts.
