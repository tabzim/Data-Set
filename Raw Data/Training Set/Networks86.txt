 "Federated end-to-end authentication for the constrained internet of things using ibc and ecc." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015.
Authentication of smart objects is a major challenge for the Internet of Things (IoT), and has been left open in DTLS. Leveraging locally managed IPv6 addresses with identitybased cryptography (IBC), we propose an efficient end-to-end authentication that (a) assigns a robust and deploymentfriendly federation scheme to gateways of IoT subnetworks, and (b) has been evaluated with a modern twisted Edwards elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Our early results demonstrate feasibility and promise efficiency after ongoing optimisations.
