Programming the home and enterprise WiFi with OpenSDWN." ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review. Vol. 45. No. 4. ACM, 2015.
The quickly growing demand for wireless networks and the numerous application-specific requirements stand in stark contrast to today's inflexible management and operation of WiFi networks. In this paper, we present and evaluate O PEN SDWN, a novel WiFi architecture based on an SDN/NFV approach. O PEN SDWN exploits datapath programmability to enable service differentiation and fine-grained transmission control, facilitating the prioritization of critical applications. O PEN SDWN implements per-client virtual access points and per-client virtual middleboxes, to render network functions more flexible and support mobility and seamless migration. O PEN SDWN can also be used to out-source the control over the home network to a participatory interface or to an Internet Service Provider.
