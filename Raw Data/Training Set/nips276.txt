This paper describes a Bayesian graph matching algorithm for 
data-mining from large structural data-bases. The matching al- 
gorithm uses edge-consistency and node attribute similarity to de- 
termine the a posterJori probability of a query graph for each of the 
candidate matches in the data-base. The node feature-vectors are 
constructed by computing normalised histograms of pairwise ge- 
ometric attributes. Attribute similarity is assessed by computing 
the Bhattacharyya distance between the histograms. Recognition 
is realised by selecting the candidate from the data-base which has 
the largest a posterJori probability. We illustrate the recognition 
technique on a data-base containing 2500 line patterns extracted 
from real-world imagery. Here the recognition technique is shown 
to significantly outperform a number of algorithm alternatives.
