"Discontinuous Recall Transitions Induced By Competition Between Short- and Long-Range Interactions in Recurrent Networks." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We present exact analytical equilibrium solutions for a class of recur- 
rent neural network models, with both sequential and parallel neuronal 
dynamics, in which there is a tunable competition between nearest- 
neighbour and long-range synaptic interactions. This competition is 
found to induce novel coexistence phenomena as well as discontinuous 
transitions between pattern recall states, 2-cycles and non-recall states.
