"Predictive Approaches For Choosing Hyperparameters in Gaussian Processes." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
Gaussian Processes are powerful regression models specified by 
parametrized mean and covariance functions. Standard approaches 
to estimate these parameters (known by the name Hyperparam- 
eters) are Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum APosterior 
(MAP) approaches. In this paper, we propose and investigate pre- 
dictive approaches, namely, maximization of Geisser's Surrogate 
Predictive Probability (GPP) and minimization of mean square er- 
ror with respect to GPP (referred to as Geisser's Predictive mean 
square Error (GPE)) to estimate the hyperparameters. We also 
derive results for the standard Cross-Validation (CV) error and 
make a comparison. These approaches are tested on a number of 
problems and experimental results show that these approaches are 
strongly competitive to existing approaches.
