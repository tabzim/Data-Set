"Low Power Wireless Communication via Reinforcement Learning." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
This paper examines the application of reinforcement learning to a wire- 
less communication problem. The problem requires that channel util- 
ity be maximized while simultaneously minimizing battery usage. We 
present a solution to this multi-criteria problem that is able to signifi- 
cantly reduce power consumption. The solution uses a variable discount 
factor to capture the effects of battery usage.
