We first show how to represent sharp posterior probability distribu- 
tions using real valued coefficients on broadly-tuned basis functions. 
Then we show how the precise times of spikes can be used to con- 
vey the real-valued coefficients on the basis functions quickly and 
accurately. Finally we describe a simple simulation in which spik- 
ing neurons learn to model an image sequence by fitting a dynamic 
generafive model.
