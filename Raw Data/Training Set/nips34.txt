"Dynamics of Supervised Learning with Restricted Training Sets and Noisy Teachers." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We generalize a recent formalism to describe the dynamics of supervised 
learning in layered neural networks, in the regime where data recycling 
is inevitable, to the case of noisy teachers. Our theory generates reliable 
predictions for the evolution in time of training- and generalization er- 
rors, and extends the class of mathematically solvable learning processes 
in large neural networks to those situations where overfitting can occur.
