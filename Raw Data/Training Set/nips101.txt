"An Oculo-Motor System with Multi-Chip Neuromorphic Analog VLSI Control." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
A system emulating the functionality of a moving eye hence the name 
oculo-motor system--has been built and successfully tested. It is made 
of an optical device for shifting the field of view of an image sensor by up 
to 45 o in any direction, four neuromorphic analog VLSI circuits imple- 
menting an oculo-motor control loop, and some off-the-shelf electronics. 
The custom integrated circuits communicate with each other primarily by 
non-arbitrated address-event buses. The system implements the behav- 
iors of saliency-based saccadic exploration, and smooth pursuit of light 
spots. The duration of saccades ranges from 45 ms to 100 ms, which is 
comparable to human eye performance. Smooth pursuit operates on light 
sources moving at up to 50 ø/s in the visual field.
