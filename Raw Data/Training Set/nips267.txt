"Orientation Scale and Discontinuity as Emergent Properties of Illusory Contour Shape." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
A recent neural model of illusory contour formation is based on 
a distribution of natural shapes traced by particles moving with 
constant speed in directions given by Brownian motions. The input 
to that model consists of pairs of position and direction constraints 
and the output consists of the distribution of contours joining all 
such pairs. In general, these contours will not be closed and their 
distribution will not be scale-invariant. In this paper, we show 
how to compute a scale-invariant distribution of closed contours 
given position constraints alone and use this result to explain a 
well known illusory contour effect.
