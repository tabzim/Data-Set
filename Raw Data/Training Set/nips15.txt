The complexity of conical circuits may be characterized by the number 
of synapses per neuron. We study the dependence of complexity on the 
fraction of the conical volume that is made up of"wire" (that is, of axons 
and dendrites), and find that complexity is maximized when wire takes 
up about 60% of the conical volume. This prediction is in good agree- 
ment with experimental observations. A consequence of our arguments 
is that any rearrangement of neurons that takes more wire would sacrifice 
computational power.
