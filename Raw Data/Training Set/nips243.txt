"Analog VLSI Cellular Implementation of the Boundary Contour System." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.  
We present an analog VLSI cellular architecture implementing a simpli- 
-fled version of the Boundary Contour System (BCS) for real-time image 
processing. Inspired by neuromorphic models across several layers of 
visual cortex, the design integrates in each pixel the functions of sim- 
ple cells, complex cells, hyper-complex cells, and bipole cells, in three 
orientations interconnected on a hexagonal grid. Analog current-mode 
CMOS circuits are used throughout to perform edge detection, local inhi- 
bition, directionally selective long-range diffusive kernels, and renormal- 
izing global gain control. Experimental results from a fabricated 12 x 10 
pixel prototype in 1.2/zm CMOS technology demonstrate the robustness 
of the architecture in selecting image contours in a cluttered and noisy 
background.
