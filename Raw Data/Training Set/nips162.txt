"Contrast adaptation in simple cells by changing the transmitter release probability." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999.
The contrast response function (CRF) of many neurons in the primary vi- 
sual cortex saturates and shifts towards higher contrast values following 
prolonged presentation of high contrast visual stimuli. Using a recurrent 
neural network of excitatory spiking neurons with adapting synapses we 
show that both effects could be explained by a fast and a slow compo- 
nent in the synaptic adaptation. (i) Fast synaptic depression leads to sat- 
uration of the CRF and phase advance in the cortical response to high 
contrast stimuli. (ii) Slow adaptation of the synaptic transmitter release 
probability is derived such that the mutual information between the input 
and the output of a cortical neuron is maximal. This component--given 
by infomax learning rule--explains contrast adaptation of the averaged 
membrane potential (DC component) as well as the surprising experi- 
mental result, that the stimulus modulated component (F1 component) 
of a cortical cell's membrane potential adapts only weakly. Based on our 
results, we propose a new experiment to estimate the strength of the ef- 
fective excitatory feedback to a cortical neuron, and we also suggest a 
relatively simple experimental test to justify our hypothesized synaptic 
mechanism for contrast adaptation.
