"Learning to Parse Images." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
We describe a class of probabilistic models that we call credibility 
networks. Using parse trees as internal representations of images, 
credibility networks are able to perform segmentation and recog- 
nition simultaneously, removing the need for ad hoc segmentation 
heuristics. Promising results in the problem of segmenting hand- 
written digits were obtained.
