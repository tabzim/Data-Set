"Better Generative Models for Sequential Data Problems: Bidirectional Recurrent Mixture Density Networks." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000.
This paper describes bidirectional recurrent mixture density networks, which can model multi-modal distributions of the type 
P(xtly T) and P(xtlxl,x2,...,xt_,y T) without any explicit assumptions about the use of context. These expressions occur frequently in pattern recognition problems with sequential data, for 
example in speech recognition. Experiments show that the proposed generative models give a higher likelihood on test data compared to a traditional modeling approach, indicating that they can 
summarize the statistical properties of the data better.
