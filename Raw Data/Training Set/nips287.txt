"Non-linear PI Control Inspired by Biological Control Systems." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
A non-linear modification to PI control is motivated by a model 
of a signal transduction pathway active in mammalian blood pres- 
sure regulation. This control algorithm, labeled PII (proportional 
with intermittent integral), is appropriate for plants requiring ex- 
act set-point matching and disturbance attenuation in the presence 
of infrequent step changes in load disturbances or set-point. The 
proportional aspect of the controller is independently designed to 
be a disturbance attenuator and set-point matching is achieved 
by intermittently invoking an integral controller. The mechanisms 
observed in the Angiotensin II/AT1 signaling pathway are used to 
control the switching of the integral control. Improved performance 
over PI control is shown on a model of cyclopentenol production. 
A sign change in plant gain at the desirable operating point causes 
traditional PI control to result in an unstable system. Applica- 
tion of this new approach to this problem results in stable exact 
set-point matching for achievable set-points.
