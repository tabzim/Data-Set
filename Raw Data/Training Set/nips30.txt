"A Variational Bayesian Framework for Graphical Models." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
This paper presents a novel practical framework for Bayesian model 
averaging and model selection in probabilistic graphical models. 
Our approach approximates full posterior distributions over model 
parameters and structures, as well as latent variables, in an analyt- 
ical manner. These posteriors fall out of a free-form optimization 
procedure, which naturally incorporates conjugate priors. Unlike 
in large sample approximations, the posteriors are generally non- 
Gaussian and no Hessian needs to be computed. Predictive quanti- 
ties are obtained analytically. The resulting algorithm generalizes 
the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm, and its conver- 
gence is guaranteed. We demonstrate that this approach can be 
applied to a large class of models in several domains, including 
mixture models and source separation.
