"Scale Mixtures of Gaussians and the Statistics of Natural Images." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2000. 
The statistics of photographic images, when represented using 
multiscale (wavelet) bases, exhibit two striking types of non- 
Gaussian behavior. First, the marginal densities of the coefficients 
have extended heavy tails. Second, the joint densities exhibit vari- 
ance dependencies not captured by second-order models. We ex- 
amine properties of the class of Gaussian scale mixtures, and show 
that these densities can accurately characterize both the marginal 
and joint distributions of natural image wavelet coefficients. This 
class of model suggests a Markov structure, in which wavelet coeffi- 
cients are linked by hidden scaling variables corresponding to local 
image structure. We derive an estimator for these hidden variables, 
and show that a nonlinear "normalization" procedure can be used 
to Gaussianize the coefficients.
