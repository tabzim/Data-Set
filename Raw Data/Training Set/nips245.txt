"A Micropower CMOS Adaptive Amplitude and Shift Invariant Vector Quantiser." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 1999. 
In this paper we describe the architecture, implementation and experi- 
mental results for an Intracardiac Electrogram (ICEG) classification and 
compression chip. The chip processes and vector-quantises 30 dimen- 
sional analogue vectors while consuming a maximum of 2.5 W power 
for a heart rate of 60 beats per minute (1 vector per second) from a 3.3 V 
supply. This represents a significant advance on previous work which 
achieved ultra low power supervised morphology classification since the 
template matching scheme used in this chip enables unsupervised blind 
classification of abnormal rhythms and the computational support for low 
bit rate data compression. The adaptive template matching scheme used 
is tolerant to amplitude variations, and inter- and intra-sample time shifts.
